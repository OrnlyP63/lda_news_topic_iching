0,"Update for 2021Things may be getting back to 'normal' to some extent, but it would be a shame not to keep these gatherings going. 'Normal' seems to be a way off yet for most of us, doesn’t it? Let's keep on meeting -  every other week, on Thursdays (starting on the January 7th). As always, the live gatherings are open to both Change Circle and WikiWing members, but the recordings will only be available inside Change Circle.~~~~~~~~Since we need connection now more than ever - to Yi and to one another - Clarity will be hosting some extra weekly  fortnightly (every-other-week-ly) video chatsWhat it isWeekly Fortnightly, hour-long video chats about Yi and readings.(And occasionally about something Yeekier, such as nuclear hexagrams.)Who it's forNormally meetings like this are just for Change Circle members, but these are for everyone in Change Circle or WikiWing. That way we limit it to people who are genuinely interested in the Yi (probably a good idea in these days of 'Zoombombing') but cost won't be a barrier.WhenMondays Thursdays at 6pm UK time. Click here to see what that is in your own timezone.I don't know how long the calls will continue for, but at least until the end of April they're too good to stop yet.WhereZoom video chat. A month ago I'd have needed to explain what that is... probably not so much now, right? I've been using it for classes since before they were famous  ; it works beautifully and is nice and easy to use.I'll be emailing the room link round to Change Circle and WikiWing members right away.How to share a readingI do much better with readings if I have a chance to think about them for a while and let them sink in. I don't think I'm alone in that, so let's share readings in advance of the calls. Here's how:If you are a member of Change Circle or WikiWing, and have a reading you'd like to share...and if and only if you are definitely coming to the next call...then please post a link to the reading on this thread.We don't want this thread to fill up with reading interpretations, so please just post a link to your reading thread in Shared Readings or Reading Circle.(Change Circle people - that means you can link to a reading in 'Reading Circle' and know it won't be shared beyond CC plus those who turn up to the call.)Last edited: Jan 4, 2021"

3,"Dear all,At last, here is something I promised a long time ago but seemed to find no time to dedicate to it and finish. The problem was compounded when some of the concepts discussed in Part 2, Section 10, ""Times,"" needed a background explanation. Said background is found, in part, in Part 1, Sections 15-31. (Pay attention, for example, at the part where a proper structure for questioning the oracle is presented.) That added quite a bit to the translation. I have also opted to keep both files separate with links to each other. Many of you have asked for a practical way to ""time"" your Yijing consultations, without obtaining a PhD in Math. Well, here it is. This is the system used by our friend Jesed every time he tried to help someone in the Shredded Readings section, before he got tired of all the useless bickering (including random threats of witchery, that are forever part of the ""Clarity Annals""... )Mr. Andreé's ""Tratado I Ching, El Canon de las Mutaciones: El Séptimo Tiempo,"" is, In my opinion, one of the best --and open--, kept secrets in Yixue. The way the work is presented, and depending on their religious bent, is either very appealing to some students or easily dismissed off-hand, due in part to the somewhat dogmatic way it is presented. Mr. Andreé, whom was born in Chile, had a career as a journalist in Europe for many years, is a professor of ""Comparative Religions,"" a writer and poet, has had a few decades of Yijing study and practice. Even though I believe he's got good command of a couple of other languages, all his work is written in his native Spanish. I've always had mix feelings about Mr. Andreé. Much in the same way that Carol Anthony has presented her work as expanding explanations and meditations upon the Wilhelm translation, Mr. Andreé has also taken Wilhelm, whom he values above any other translation, and ""expanded"" the work. A good quarter of the book is about explanations and meditations like the ones shared here in translation (a very small portion of them, to be sure). The rest of the ""I Ching Treatise"" is dedicated to the 64 Hexagrams and their explanations. He's got many interesting hexagram interactions, such as ""Ambushed Hexagrams,"" which tend to take over the ""time"" indicated by a resulting hexagram, etc. However, when I speak about my ""mixed feelings"" they are mainly due to my own rebellious self which have always shunned those that call themselves ""Masters"" and have ""following disciples."" He also considers himself a priest and his teachings are a mix of Christianity and Yijing focused philosophy. His prose is filled with allusions to ""Saints and Sages,"" for example, though no Christian saints are mentioned. At the beginning, I almost disregarded his work, mostly on the account of some of his ""disciples,"" a few of whom, other than Jesed, have crossed through the halls of Clarity in the past. (If there is something I dislike more than self-appointed masters, are the zealots that follow them without a clear understanding of what the teachings are about...). Over the years, however, and by following his work, dedication to his causes and his predictions, I have come to understand that the scale tips, heavily, on the positive side. And no, I don't subscribe to his philosophical mixture. I do respect it though, as the path he has chosen to walk and teach to others. His work is, indeed, unique.Regarding his predictions, well, he's on record of making very accurate ones related to Chilean and world affairs as well as natural disasters such as the ones that struck Chile in the last few years. The timing method described in my translations is quite useful and accurate. For those interested, there are many examples here in Clarity of the method being used by Jesed. He has always applied the method to a dot and got mostly shooed away by wispy fortune-telling ""intuition.""The ""I Ching Treatise"" isn't a ""little book""... Below are a few pictures I took this morning (that's a 26in monitor behind it). It measures 11x8.5, has some 600 pages and is hand-sewn to boot! About the size of a phone book... Oh, and it comes with its own hand-crafted yellow cloth bag for storage. A couple of disclaimers:1. I hope you'll excuse the quality of the translation itself. I've tried my best to translate some of those philosophical concepts from the Spanish but, as you can imagine, it isn't an easy task (the reason I try to understand them, when exposed, in their own language). While I've tried hard to be true to the original, there are some terms used that do not translate well into English. I'm certain it needs some heavy editing but I've no much time for that. My apologies. However, the message is there, and a promise is a promise, albeit slow in coming. 2. I will not entertain arguing with anybody about the validity of the method or Mr. Andreé as its messenger. You either like it and use it, at your own risk, or you don't. Simple as that. I have my own opinions and experiences but I fly no flags for anybody.Sorry for the long wind. This isn't even an introduction to Mr. Andreé's work but something was needed as a background. Without further ado, here are the links:Ricardo Andreé's ""Times""Ricardo Andreé, I Ching Treatise, Part 1, Sections 15 to 31-English​I hope you'll enjoy them and, indeed, find them useful in your consultations.Cheers,Last edited by a moderator: Jul 5, 2012"
4,"Greetings All,    I have  posted a complete explanation of the King Wen Sequence of the I Ching hexagrams in a new page  accessible from my website page on the Flux Tome Perspective Upon the I Ching: www.stars-n-dice.com/fluxtome.html   or directly www.stars-n-dice.com/tetraktys.html .The difference between my explanation and the others about is that mine is not based upon the King Wen Sequence being set up as 32 pairs by line structure. It does not put the hexagrams on a number line, or in a circle or along a curve of any kind. It does not assume there is anything unique to any Chinese commentary or mathematical system.Instead, my explanation is based in the philosophical framework of the Pythagorean Tetraktys or the view that a complete analysis of any subject can be made in ten specific points grouped into a  1- Monad, 2-Dyads or linear polar opposites, 3 stages of process or narrative, and 4-Tetrad of perpendicular double dichotomies.That a single Sequence fits  the 32 pairs by line structure and the Pythagorean decad analysis of the Tetraktys, and all the other mathematical and philosophical conjectures folks have developed is simply a testament to the mystic poetry of the King Wen Sequence which works from whatever perspective one might choose to employ.The benefit of the Tetraktys matrix to explain the King Wen Sequence is that it is so absolutely and totally philosophically satisfying. It has no issues of how well does it fit the algorithm, are these math or landscape points the truly right ones. It just fits into place seamlessly. However, try it out yourself and see what you find.  A bit of background on my perspective and its development:   In the late 1970's I had the opportunity to teach an astrologer friend of mine in Belgium the basics of the I Ching. In the course of our  hours of study, it suddenly occurred to me that it was now quite simple to repeat the original insight of determining the meaning of each hexagram from just the line pattern of Yang and Yin lines.The fundamental principles to achieve this clarity about the hexagrams is to make a change in perspective from the standard view of hexagrams being composed of independent Yang and Yin lines. Instead the principle is that the gua (hexagram or trigram) is a  gestalt matrix whose background state is the set of Yin line places. A trigram or hexagram is thus a matrix background which is represented graphically by all Yin lines.    The individual hexagrams are formed as the open space between the pieces of the Yin lines is either filled in as a Yang line or left open to remain gestalt background called a Yin line.The meaning of the individual line places are illustrated and explained by the Pythagorean Eidos (dot-patterns on the dice cube) from first sprout or root to structure or stem, to passion or line of development, to 4-heart or soul of inner space, to 5-complete individual organization and Self, to 6-the flower or seed pod that opens the transition to the next situation.The meaning of the hexagram arises from 2 simple principles: There is a natural structural motion from line 1 up through line 6 (the Yin process). There is a a specific dynamic from a Yang line place toward an open Yin line place.Putting these together one can understand and explain the meaning of each hexagram. One example--hexagram 3, the first and 5th line places only are Yang. The only focus is upon the beginning and the overall organization, everything else is background. This is the situation of the first application of the chisel to carve the marble sculpture. The artist has the overall plan in mind and the chisel point has begun the transition from mental image to concrete reality. Difficulty at the beginning or Strikes.After working on my Flux Tome perspective, publishing several books on the topic, and reading the Pythagorean Sourcebook and Library by Guthrie (ISBN 0-933999-51-8) I realized that the brief comments in Wilhelm hex. 11 and 41 about the King Wen Sequence being in sets of 10 which is the same decad arrangement of the Tetraktys.Looking at the hexagrams ending in 1 (1,11,21,31,41,51 and 61), starting with hexagram One Ch'ien I saw even its Chinese ideogram name referred to the concrete imagery of the  water cycle. Those first 10 hexagrams are each composed by trigrams which illustrate the water cycle from their traditional nature images: sunshine, earth topography, thunder, rain, mountain, wind and finally lake. The water cycle starts with and is fully energized and explained by the action of sunshine to produce clouds that form water that flows over the earth until it reaches the sea.The big twist is to read the King Wen sequence like a poem, that is to not get hung up with the rhymes or line value pairs; rather to keep to the philosophical matrix taking hexagram one alone as monad, two and three as polar opposites of the Planet Earth topography and the thunderstorm energy that strikes and starts the rain fall. Then the Triad narrative process of hexagrams 4-5-6 beginning with the energy given to rain falling upon a mountain to produce artesian springs or rushing torrents;  central core of the water vapor in the clouds that will eventually fall over the Earth topography and pick up that energy of elevation--and finally the rain water falling through the sunshine, no longer controlled by that energy and now controlled by its elevation over the topography.Then the final Tetrad of the double dichotomy of perpendicular axes- 7 and 8 as water absorbed into the earth and 8 water flowing along the topography. And 9 the weather systems in the atmosphere that control the motion and elevation of the clouds finally ending the entire set of 10 with the low point of the topography that fills with water where it sits quiescent under the sunshine ending one water cycle and starting the next.Q.E.D.Check it all out for yourself through www.stars-n-dice.com.Dr. Frank R.

7,"Dear fellow students of the I Ching, In my life as an artist who makes handmade books in very small editions, I created a book to illuminate the hexagrams of the I Ching using poetry and photocollage. It has two spines at the top and bottom which enables the reader to match upper and lower trigrams, and then see the images associated with those trigrams as a pair, or hexagram.

'Contemplate'(W/B) (Reflect, mine) on the conversational 6. 'Conflict' I had with a friend over politics the week before, and who, according to the reading, I should go 'halfway ' by forgiving his name calling,  6. 'A cautious halt halfway brings good fortune. Going through to the end brings misfortune.', (W/B), but stop short of reconciling with him, (going through to the end) for reasons of personal protection and avoiding any further haranguing.The new reading sheds further light on the first in that 59.

Stick to my guns, and not to ""seek the young fool"" (W/B) 4. and again continue to persevere and 'foster (my) character','giving no more instruction' to 'the ignorant (who) seeks me, (concerning a previous reading I did for him over a year ago, of which advice he has ignored repeatedly).The other aspect of 4.

(Huang).I believe this refers to 'Dispersing Childhood' memories through working with other adult children in a 12 srep fellowship out of a workbook that I ordered yesterday morning early. ie. Using the 12 step workbook to disperse or spread information about my childhood to the proper qualified persons to achieve further recovery.4. Image says:'The superior person makes every effortTo cultivate virtue with resolute deeds.' (Huang)I checked Wrbster's dictionary for these terms and the answer I got was, in my words:""I should use the ACA Workbook to 'speak out loudly'  (59.5, Huang) and spread widely ('Dispersing') what's close (or even intimate) to me about my childhood ('king's belongings'), and so act with firm determination to improve my strength and manliness of character.""Thus, ""Dispersing Childhood"".Comments?I apologize for not being able to post the link here instead of the text.

20,"March 22nd: ‘Connecting with Imagery’ WorkshopConsulting the I Ching? You will need…to know what you’re askinga sense of how the parts of a reading fit together, andto be able to get inside the oracle’s imagery.If you’re missing any of these, you’ll tend to get stuck and frustrated at some point – but anyone who’s missing #3, the ability to relate to the imagery from the inside, is barely going to be able to get started.(‘Kings? Birds? Wells? Offerings? What have they got to do with anything?’)I say ‘ability’, but really this is more of a habit – steps you learn to follow without thinking as you engage with a reading. It’s just a matter of knowing the steps and having them become second nature.And so, last June, I ran an online ‘Connecting with Imagery’ workshop, which was startlingly popular. And in the run-up to the Yijing Foundations Class (starting March 29th!) I’ve decided to re-run it, but with new examples.

25,"In 2005 Dong Shan 董珊 from the University of Beijing came across an axe that was held in a private collection. The axe, dated around 900-800 BC, contains an inscription:一六一一一六，曰：鼑（鼎）止（趾）眞（顚）；鼑（鼎）黃耳，奠止（趾）。五六一一五八，X。'一六一一一六' and 五六一一五八 are 'numerical hexagrams' that both convert to hexagram 50 ䷱. The text that follows it contains the name of hexagram 50 as well as phrases that are reminiscent of the line texts of hexagram 50.Although the provenance of the axe is unknown Dong Shan does not think it is a fake, considering the patina and other features on the axe. This find would be the earliest object that directly links the numerical hexagrams to the Zhouyi, and it also contains the earliest text sample of it.Dong Shan's original article about the axe, published in 2011, can be read here http://www.gwz.fudan.edu.cn/Web/Show/2207. Pictures of the axe can be found at the end of the article.Adam Schwartz writes in detail about the axe in his article 'Between Numbers and Images: the Many Meanings of Trigram Li 離 in the Early Yijing', published in the Bulletin of the Jao Tsung-I Academy of Sinology, Vol. 5, p. 47-84 (http://jas.hkbu.edu.hk/site/YCY/upload/mw_data/file/mw_data_2058_5b4411571ef04.pdf)Attachments20140108091242305011.jpg17.1 KB · Views: 25Last edited: Aug 2, 2019"

27,"Classical Chinese Combinatorics: Derivation of the Book of Changes Hexagram Sequence by Richard S Cook, is a massive ""proof"" regarding theYijing hexagram order (i.e. the ""received order"" or ""King Wen"" order). The puzzle of the received order has been discussed extensively over the centuries, and here on Online Clarity (use the search function to locate these).When it comes to the received order, there are perhaps three basic camps:• the order is organized by pairs but otherwise random• the order is mostly organized• the order is totally organizedCook belongs to the latter camp. He spent many years thinking through how the order might be organized, and after some insights, began creating this 600+ page analysis.Cook's book has interesting and understandable material in the introductory sections about Yijing history and some general concepts that he uses. The analysis, however, is quite technical and requires mathematical background.I've reviewed the book more extensively at Contemplating the I Ching. The book is available through Lulu (US$64).Readers should also look at József Drasny's recent in-depth review of the book at Yijing Dao (scroll down to it) as it delves much more into the technical aspects of Cook's work.Last edited: Dec 6, 2019"

29,"Hello dear Yi Jing lovers!This is my first post in this forum, although I have been roaming around here for many years.It is my pleasure to present to you a new Yi Jing work, which took more than 2 decades to complete (working off and on).This forum has proven to be a wonderful resource of questions to study, and some comments of knowledgeable members have proven most useful for exploring certain angles, ideas, or information.I apologize for not having participated sooner in the exchanges here, but I found it inappropriate to do so before publishing my book.As a ""thank you"" to all those who have been contributing to this forum, and as a winter solstice present, I'm giving away my book (more than 900 pages) for free, until dec. 31, 2019!The direct download link for the full PDF is[available from Jian Lee on request]After this date, the book will go on sale. How, where, and at what price is still under consideration, so an update will be posted here.I created a small website for the book, at the following (temporary) URL:[redacted]It also offers an archive of a selection of questions with my interpretations. I lifted a number of questions from this forum. If you like to check if a question of yours is there, then search the page using your forum name, it should come up.It seemed inappropriate to post these interpretations here, as generally they are from very old topics. But if you feel some should be copy+pasted here, then feel free to do that.You can find the archive (of presently 83 questions + answers) at[redacted]If you have questions about any of these, it will be a pleasure to answer them.The main goal for writing this book has been to ""fill in the blanks"", providing indications where the traditional Yi Jing texts and contemporary versions leave them open, or uncertain, all the while staying as close as possible to the ""received text"".It will be great to read about your experiences with this text. Does it offer clarification where other versions leave room for doubt? Is it easy to read, regardless of the unusual text presentation and the many brackets? Do you agree with the texts (names, image, judgment, lines, etc)? Did you find a typo?You might like to read the text for castings you did in the past, or new ones, and see how it works for you.I hope you will enjoy it, and will find it helpful.Happy winter solstice!JLLast edited by a moderator: Nov 28, 2019"

32,"Yijing Foundations Class (starting this Sunday)Starting on Sunday, September 15th, a small group of like-minded students will embark on a 12 week journey from ‘The Yijing is fascinating, but I’m not really confident with it…’ to a fluent, dependable, individual relationship with Yi as guide and companion. (Might you be one of them?)This is the Yijing Foundations Class, and since this will be the first time I’ve run it since 2015, I thought I should explain what it’s about and how it works…YijingYou know this part But perhaps it’s still important to say that for me – and hence in this class – the Yijing is an oracle. Yes, it’s also a work of art and a repository of deeply-encoded wisdom, but those things are only possible because it’s an oracle.That means it only comes alive, it’s only knowable at all, when you get into conversation so it can speak to you. Then, it can give you insight – a profound vision of your own multi-dimensional, full-colour reality: the currents you’re swimming in, the meaning of your experience, the direction of the flow. (And yes, this includes what it would be like to pursue a relationship with X, or how best to apply for a raise, or what’s gone wrong with your computer this time: it’s all real, so it’s all included.)Conversation with Yi is what we call ‘readings’ (a maybe misleadingly passive term for a very active, two-way process). The Class is based on your readings, right from the start, because that’s where the oracle lives.FoundationsThe trouble with learning the Yijing is that it never ends. (If you ever find anyone who says they’ve mastered it and have no more to learn, run away very fast.) There are always more patterns hidden in the structure, more research insights to integrate, more interpretive tools to experiment with, more to see……which is why I decided to find the foundations. What were all my readings built on? What concepts and approaches were indispensable to me? And so I gathered together my ‘desert island’ Yijing interpretation kit and built it into a syllabus.Consequently, there’s a lot that isn’t in the Foundations syllabus: line pathways, big beautiful Sequence patterns, nuclear stories… While these are all exciting, creative, mind-expanding ways to engage with readings, they’re not foundational. They’re more like the conservatory you have built on as an extension: the light and spaciousness they add could transform your whole experience of the place, but you can live without them. And also, a conservatory without foundations would collapse.(Overworked metaphors apart, this really is how it works: the advanced tools are optional. They can transform your relationship with Yi, but you can also do good, useful readings that make a positive difference in your life without ever touching them. And adding in extra hexagrams, trigrams and lines to think about before you’re fully at home with the basic framework of primary, relating and moving lines is counterproductive, to say the least.)ClassThe Yijing Foundations Course is always available inside Change Circle, for you to study in your own time. The Yijing Foundations Class runs from September 15th to December 8th, with weekly classes (by video chat) and a private forum for daily support and feedback, one module and assignment at a time.So the Class is for you if…you’re looking for more support along the wayyou appreciate the benefits of learning as part of a small groupyou know you learn better with structure…and above all, if you know you want to start now, and build confidence and fluency in your readings in time for the New Year.We start on Sunday, so please have a look at the details now and decide whether you’d like to join us.Last edited: Sep 10, 2019"

37,"Refurbishing? Remodelling?    The I Ching Community will be migrating, fairly soon, to some new forum  software. I don’t want to say, ‘We’re moving,’ because at the end of the process  the forums will still be accessible at the same address as before. But they’ll  look somewhat different and work somewhat differently, so there’ll be a bit of a  learning curve for us all.Why change?    Three reasons: bugs, future-proofing, and just making them  better.The bugs    If you’ve spent any time round the I Ching Community, you’ve probably met  these. Posts in one big text block because the software ran all the paragraphs  together, posts that can’t be edited, and also occasional database error messages. Oh, and no Chinese characters, because when I followed tech support’s instructions to  enable those, a whole swathe of other features promptly died.    There are  workarounds for the paragraph and editing bugs (switch to the standard editor,  open the ‘edit’ link in a new tab), and members put up with this with  remarkably good grace, but it would be nice not to have to, wouldn’t it?    (Incidentally, those workarounds were discovered by kind members,  experimenting industriously in search of a fix. The tech support people are just  not that interested.)Future-proofing    Our current software is no longer being updated. This wouldn’t be a problem,  except that everything else about the internet is constantly being  updated. Sooner or later, some other part of Clarity is going to require some of  those updates, and the forum won’t allow them, and we’ll be stuck.     Besides, most online conversations nowadays work faster and more  smoothly. Like I said, Clarity’s members have been altogether lovely at putting  up with occasional clunkiness, but increasingly people’s expectations are set by  social media companies with multi-squillion development budgets. We can’t  exactly catch up with them (slight shortage of squillions here), but we could do better for ourselves.    We need to move to something that’s being updated, and vBulletin 5  (we’re currently on vBulletin 4) is almost-universally regarded as rubbish.  (Also, I’m quite tired of profoundly uninterested tech support people.) So…  I’ve decided to switch to XenForo. It may be more of a change to get used to at first,  but it’ll be worth it.Better forums    The more I see of XenForo, the more it just looks better than  vBulletin. It’s more user-friendly when it comes to finding what you’re interested in, getting updates and keeping track, quick and easy self-expression and so on. I  keep finding thoughtful touches in unexpected places. (For instance, how about  getting notified when someone quotes a post of yours?) It’ll be a more hospitable environment all round – I’ll share some screenshots and videos  over the coming week or two to show you what I mean.What happens next?    Basically, you just use the old forums as usual, while I chase my tail in circles and spend silly amounts of money to get it all set up. On Migration Day, the forums will be closed for a time, and after that it’ll take a little while to get hexagram search and WikiWing  integrated with the new system.    For now… er, watch this space? I’ll keep you posted, show you how some of  the shiny new features work, and let you know as soon as I have a date for Migration Day."

39,"https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Zhou-Book-Changes/dp/1630516880This is a translation of Liu Dajun's 周易概论. I have the Chinese original and I wonder why this book has been chosen to be translated to English. Even the revised edition, published in 2016 (but with a foreword By Liu from 2008?) appears a bit outdated because it does not discuss the latest (and exciting) archaeological findings. It does have interesting chapters, touches on important topics (I like the chapters on guaqi 卦氣, but do we need another book that discusses the examples from the Guoyu and Zuozhuan?)The chapters where he explains certain lines from the Zhouyi add nothing to the wealth of research that has already been done by Richard Rutt, Dennis Schilling and Stephen Field, to name but a few. And I could go on.Even more, there is something in it that I find...disturbing. I was reading the part about the earliest appearance of the Houtian Bagua and the Guaqi theory (《更早的后天八卦与“卦气”说资料》 on p. 234 of my Chinese edition). He mentions the famous 'Four Winds' plastron & scapula, and postulates the hypothesis that it is the earliest description of the Houtian Bagua. The several exclamation marks in this chapter make it appear that he thinks he made a huge discovery. However, what he describes, including specific readings of the characters on the bones, has already been mentioned by Lian Shaoming 連劭名 in 1988, in Wenwu 文物 1988.11, p. 40-44 (""商代的四方風名與八卦""), as mentioned by David N. Keightley in The Ancestral Landscape, p. 71, footnote 45. The chapter in which Liu describes this in his book is not found in the original edition of 1983. I assume it has been added in 2004 or later. I find it hard to believe that Liu was not aware of Lian Shaoming's article, as it was published in a journal Liu no doubt had access to. Yet he does not mention it. Throughout his book Liu does not seem to mention research by colleagues at all. He does mention some titles of books but he does not give credit to other scholars.Some months ago I found this webpage where Liu is accused of plagiarism: http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_4aad6d0f0102y6w7.htmlApart from these disturbing findings a friend who read the page proof of the English translation before publishing said it ""is flawed in many ways (mainly poor English and some faulty transliterations)"".It's also ridiculously expensive."
40,"For a really good understanding of your own Yijing readings, I think there are basically two things you need to know:How the parts of a reading work together.How to connect with its imagery.(Click here to skip this blog post and just register for the workshop.)The first of those can get a little ‘techie’, but all you really need to know to get started isthe moving line(s) take(s) precedence, andthe relating hexagram is part of the reading now (and often describes what this is all about for you).Once you’re casting your own readings, having your own conversations with Yi, you’ll rapidly develop your own sense of how it speaks to you……provided you can connect with its imagery.If that’s a problem for you – if you find yourself looking at a reading and just not seeing what horses (or sacred vessels, or crossing rivers) have to do with relationships (or career moves, or awkward conversations) – then no amount of structural know-how is going to help.At this moment of ‘Huh?’ and ‘Whut?’ and ‘Does not compute’, you don’t need more rules or formulas – you mostly just need to be able to engage your imagination. There are simple ways of doing that.(Also a smidgen of background knowledge helps, as imagination-food. There are simple ways to find that, too.)So… I’m running a modest online workshop on Sunday 23rd, when I’ll show you some simple ways of connecting with the imagery, understanding your reading from the inside, and seeing how it applies to your question.For details, and to sign up, please click here!"

Then the subsequent lessons describe each kind of pair in turn: how the hexagrams are related, what this means for readings, what questions to ask yourself to engage with them in practice.

44,"An interesting new translation is out of Cheng Yi's The Yi River Commentary on the Book of Changes, edited and translated by L. Michael Harrington, with Introduction by L. Michael Harrington and Robin R. Wang from Yale University Press, 2019.Cheng Yi (1033–1107) lived during the Song dynasty, and was one of the era’s great thinkers. His Yijing work greatly influenced subsequent generations.  Harrington's version is extremely thorough, and includes introduction to Cheng's thoughts, notes, glossary. People may be familiar with Cheng Yi's commentary from Thomas Cleary's version I Ching: The Tao of Organization. The translator estimates that Cleary's version is drastically abridged, by more than 50%. Highly recommended for serious readers.Read my review at Contemplating the I Ching."

53,"If you already know you want a reading…I’m just opening the doors for my full I Ching reading service, for the first time in ages. (If you’ve already signed up on the readings page, you should have had an email about this last week.) If this is something you’re definitely interested in now, please visit the page, read the details and sign up for the ‘Ways of Opening’ booklet to help find your question. You’ll get an email right away with both the booklet and a link to an ‘Introductions’ form – please follow it!(And please do this now, before I close again!)If you’re not sure…How is this different from an ‘I Ching chat’?In a nutshell – it’s more complete, and it costs more.I Ching chats are more or less always available for booking, and cost £30 (unless you are a Change Circle member, in which case it’s free). You book a chat, send me the basic information about your reading, and we talk for 30 minutes – long enough to give you insight into the reading’s core message, but nowhere near long enough to explore it fully.Full readings are only available occasionally, and only for five people at a time, to ensure I can give my full attention to each person. This service costs £200 (unless you are a Change Circle member, in which case you get a £50 discount), and is more of a shared journey.We start out with a call to find your question – my chance to concentrate on listening to you intently to understand your situation. Then there’s a long, spacious call to explore the reading (normally this takes about an hour), and I send you a recording and a written summary of this. And then we have a further three follow-up calls as you’re integrating your understanding of the reading. We might explore more facets of the original reading, see how it interacts with your dreams, or discuss a follow-up reading if something needs asking.As you can imagine, this kind of deep-dive exploration is better suited to a big question that you want to spend some time on.What’s changing this timeLike I said, I only open for full readings intermittently, and only for five people at a time. This normally means there are more people who want readings than I can accommodate. In the past, I’ve just emailed everyone who signed up for ‘Ways of Opening’ to say, ‘I’m open, here’s the booking link for the question-finding call,’ and the first five people to sign up would be the ones I read for.This was nice and simple, but not especially well-thought-out! I might discuss questions with someone, only to realise I wasn’t the right person to help them after all. Meanwhile, there might be someone else who would have greatly benefitted from a reading, but who hadn’t even seen the email until after all the calls were booked (which often happened within an hour of pressing ‘send’). And it was all unnecessarily frenetic.So this time, I’m trying something different. When you sign up for Ways of Opening, you’ll be sent a link to an ‘introductions form’ where you can introduce me to yourself and your question. That way, if there are more than five people who’d like a reading, I can choose those I feel I can help best. (And if someone does drop out after the opening call – which also sometimes happens because once you’re clear on the question you find you already know the answer! – then I’ll already know whom to ask next.)This also means I can tell you when I’m closing the doors this time: January 14th is the absolute last day to send in an ‘introductions’ form.If you’d like a reading this time, please sign up on the readings page and ‘introduce yourself’ via the form today.(And if you might like a reading in future, please sign up on the readings page so I can notify you when I next open.)"
54,"Hi el al. Follow a discussion on how the Hexagrams fit together as opposite binary images, which hold a math of Heaven and Earth 1 to 10, which fits into the Ho Tu to produce the 2160, 4320, 8640 and the value's of The Great Year, I posted a copy of a large book that has been written over a long period of time as a wrks file only.. This book has never been published but what was written to be an introduction to it was, this book being published under the name of 'The Sum of Things' that is now reprinted as a second edition by Morrigan Books is on sale through ABE Books or Readers.ie. (All details of the math and book are on my site I Ching Math).The wrks file put up for sharing has a working title of 'The Book of Divine Revelations' - 'The Law's of the Sacred Mountain' and it's a private work untaken over 45 yrs of investigation of the symbolism and therefore the narrative contained within the verses of the I Ching as translated by Wilhelm - a book that I've constantly read and used since I was 15 yrs old and I still use the same book that I got when 17 as I lost the first one. So this book as do the math contained in 'The Sum of Things' shows how the hexagrams match as binary opposites and not as the reversal sequence of Wen. The Trigram Sequence of The Well and Bagua are firstly fitted together in the Ho Tu as a 1 to 8 sequence of trigrams with the father and mother being 1 and 8, the eldest children as 2 and 7, the middle children as 3 and 6, plus the youngest as 4 and 5, as these pairings come together as having an equal value the order given in the Lo Shu = 1,8,2,7,4,5,3 and 6. The reasons behind both the inner sequence of Ch'ien, Sun, Li, Tui, Ken, K'an, Chen, K'un and then a placement where the trigrams 3 and 6 Li and K'an become the ends as the Outer Sequence is fully explained, not only in the math but also in the directions contained in the Great Treatise. This is all for the reader's own deliberations (as i said this is/was a private book - one used only for own readings). So if anyone wishes to read it then the password is IChingCom and the URL =https://files.me.com/paulmartynsmith/18rkq6So all I can add is that I hope some find it of use in there own works. Please note that the math now appearing in many aspects of other people's work is copyrighted as it gives a firm base of how the values of The Great Year are obtained, or why the value of 360 or 720 is paramount, as these values go on to give the Contracted Integer to Binary Image match seen also in the value's of Solfeggio Tones and Rodin's Torus in the 8 Spoke Wheel and the Nine Stack, but this should not deter anyone from adding their own knowledge to it, and sharing the work with those who are interested.

With hindsight, the progression of changes from one moving line to the next , in single step,  seems most logical and reasonable, but some how it has escaped me for all these years .     I have been able to enhance an old computer program of mine, called E-KING (Electronic Key and Instant Gateway to I Ching),  to encapsulate the above idea. This software is now offered freely to the Clarity Community .     E-KING was first written some twenty odd years ago, designed to run even on the most humble MS-DOS computer. It's old-fashioned and plain, but it works well to assist all students of I Ching in various ways . The original MS-DOS version of E-KING is no longer compatible with modern WINDOWS computers . Fortunately, I recently discovered a free tool on the net (at QB64.org) which enabled me to recompile and revive E-KING to run on contemporary machines . So here it is, in a zip file :     https://1drv.ms/u/s!AqlT81ICDn2ejlBg4bK5oB3W1yDG"

59,"I asked Hilary if she'd consider offering her book in a Kindle (or other e-book) format. She told me that decision is up to the publisher, but that I (or we) could tell them we'd like to see a Kindle version. You can go to the book's page on Amazon, and a ways down on the page (near the product details), you'll find a way to request a Kindle version of the book. (I looked but did not see a way to request it in Nook format.)You can also look to see if other books have this option. For example, I saw you can make a Kindle request for Stephan Karcher's book, and I assume there are others. Wilhelm's book is already offered in that format. Best, DavidLast edited: Aug 31, 2018"

64,"The idea (which I had a few days ago) is that the 8 trigrams come in pairs of the ""Greek"" elements Fire, Air, Water and Earth *such that* for each element one of the two trigrams holds/binds its element together, while the other trigram lets go of it, releases it.*EARTH- Mountain (male, 3rd son) holds Earth together (""resting"", ""keeping still""), like hard rock.- Earth (female, mother) lets Earth go (""devoted/yielding"", ""receptive""), like soft loess or sand.WATER- Lake (female, 3rd daughter) holds Water together.- Water (male, 2nd son) lets Water go, releases it (rain, stream).AIR- Heaven (male, father) holds Air together (""strong"").- Wind (female, 1st daughter) lets Air flow freely.FIRE- Fire (female, 2nd daughter) holds Fire together (flame, ""clinging"").- Thunder (male, 1st son) lets Fire go, releases its energy (lightning).Pretty obvious and fundamental once you look at it like this, I find. Or not? Not sure how to make this more publicly visible, though... (I think this is something that would probably interest many people interested in the I Ching...) Maybe I will just write a short article for the time being.Alain Stalder* Attribution to Greek elements is not new, but I think the bind/release duality is."

69,"Shamelessly plugging myself because I can use all the attention that I can get:If you study the Chinese Book of Changes and one or more of the following statements applies to you then this two-day Yijing Workshop Intensive is for you:When I consult the Yijing I often find it difficult to interpret the answerI do not always understand the language used by the YijingI only use the text of the Yijing, and I would like to do more with the hexagramI do not know how to interpret the trigramsI know that every line of a hexagram has a meaning, and would like to know and use themI’m curious how others use the YijingI have been using the Yijing for years, but still feel like a beginnerI want to know more about the Chinese philosophy behind the YijingI want to integrate the Yijing into my own professionIn two fascinating days you will learn how to get the most out of your Yijing experience. This is what the workshop will cover:Day 1: the Value of the HexagramsMost users of the Yijing, the Chinese Book of Changes, are not familiar with the practical value of the oldest layer of the book: the sixty-four hexagrams. They only read the text and the additional commentary & interpretation, but it is the text that is the most difficult part of the book, it is the part that baffles the reader the most. If you know how to read and apply the hexagrams and its layers you have an extra tool to interpret the answer of the Yi and to arrive at a better understanding of the text. That is why we start the workshop with an exploration of the hexagrams and their use. In this workshop you will learn the following:The composition of the Zhouyi, the foundation of the YijingHow the ancient Chinese saw the hexagrams, how they used them and what we can learn from themHow to not ask questionsThe coin method of consulting the YijingThe practical value of the trigrams and linesHow these interactHow to read moving lines in combination with the trigramsThe trigrams & lines connection of Lai Zhide 來知德 (1525-1604)The trigrams connected to the yarrow and coin methods as described by Zhang Li 張理 (±1364)The nuclear trigrams and the baoti 包體 (‘enveloping trigrams’)How to gather all this data in a structured way to arrive at a meaningful interpretation of the Yi’s answer without reading the book.All this will be illustrated by examples as well as cases provided by the members of the workshop.At the end of this day you will know how to read the hexagram with confidence and you will be less dependent on the text of the Yijing.Day 2: Working with the Text of the YijingThe hexagrams and all its layers are an important part of the Yi. The other part is formed by the text that accompanies each hexagram and its lines. The hexagrams and its text are the yin and yang of the Yijing. In this workshop we will focus on the text of the Book of Changes. You will learn the following:The composition of the text. A bit of history and background of the original Chinese textThe difference between translations and interpretations: what makes translating the Yi so difficult and why are there so many versions of the book?Why to never use an interpretationHow do you choose the version that fits you?Which layers are there in the text?Often used images and words: the symbolic language of the YijingHow to analyze the text and find what it means to youHow to let the images speakWhat to read and what not to readHow to combine the meaning of the hexagram with the meaning of the textWe will combine the theory with practical examples from Chinese literature as well as cases from the participants.At the end of this day you will find it much easier to read the text of the Yijing and you will have tools to interpret the symbols of the text and its layers with confidence.RequirementsPen and paperA good translation of the YijingYou can also bring all your other Yi books with you to show the other participants what is available these days; we can discuss the value of these books with the group.Suitable forBeginners and experienced users who want to appreciate the symbolic language of the Book of Changes and want to harness the power of the hexagramsDate:October 6-7, 2018; time 10:00 – 17:00Location:50 Broadway, New York 10004Investment:$160How to pay:credit card or PayPal (after registration)Registration:https://www.yjcn.nl/wp/2-day-yijing-workshop-intensive-new-york/This is what students say about the Yijing Workshop Intensive:“This Workshop Intensive has fundamentally improved my understanding of the Yijing even though I have been working with the Yijing for more than ten years. I got my knowledge mainly from introductions in books, and this workshop is an absolute necessary addition to it. Harmen inspires confidence: not only does he master his profession, he is also able to communicate his own personal perspectives clearly and well-founded.”“It is a fun, informative workshop where you quickly learn how to interpret the hexagrams and the texts. Harmen’s way of explaining the Yi is fascinating.”“An absolute must! Inspiring lessons.”“A very interesting and inspiring workshop with a lot of understandable information and sufficient opportunity to ask questions and practice the material. It also gives practical and personal information for each participant which makes it a sparkling and dynamic workshop.”“Interesting, low-threshold and understandable for everyone; not audacious but realistic and grounded.”“For a beginner this workshop is very easy to follow.”“A good introduction to the Yijing based on the earliest sources and their interpretation. Elaborate explanation of the interpretations of your own Yijing consultations which gives you new insights. Also clear analysis of books that have appeared about the Yijing and their value (or lack of it.)”About Harmen MeskerHarmen (1966) started his study of the Yijing in 1982 when he was sixteen years old. Over the years he has expanded his knowledge and experience and shares this through courses, workshops and lectures with the rest of the world. His main interests are the history and language of the Yi, as well as the oldest usage of the book in early China. Harmen studied Chinese to keep up with the latest developments and to be able to read the oldest Chinese books on the Yi. He is one of the initiators of the Dutch Foundation for Yi Studies and has published several books on the Yijing (in Dutch). In 2016 Harmen was appointed as chief editor of the renewed version of the Dutch edition of Richard Wilhelm’s Yijing translation. He recently started a YouTube channel (called YiTube) that will show instructional videos on all aspects concerning the Yi. On his website www.yjcn.nl he shares his latest projects as well as an ongoing research journal on the text of the Book of Changes. Harmen is frequently consulted to assist with the translation of old Chinese texts and had an advisory role in several Dutch translations of Daoist inner alchemy texts.What others say about Harmen:“Harmen is tireless in pursuing greater knowledge of the Yijing. A true scholar, diligently and precise in what he writes and tells. He is a source of wisdom to many, and next to that a very nice person, who selflessly shares his knowledge.”“Harmen is a special person with a unique, Taoist like, sense of humor.  I learned Harmen to be a very dedicated, serious and in depth researcher of the Yijing with an incredible knowledge about its history. He is my most appreciated and helpful teacher and I owe him a lot for helping me in my study and development. He likes to share his knowledge and extensive library with others and to stimulate information exchange within the Yijing communities in the Netherlands and abroad. His book Dutch book De I Tjing in ons leven is a very practical and useful book to study and experience the use of this famous book. His introduction courses about the Yijing are recommendable as well.”“Without any doubt is Harmen one of the leading experts in the field of Yijing-knowledge. Not only in relation to the Chinese language of the ancient time, but also with introductions for beginners and matured users of the book.”“Harmen Mesker is an internationally renowned expert of the YiJing. His knowledge of this field is vast and he loves to share it.”“One of the best consultants I’ve the pleasure to work with. I’ve known Harmen for a very long time and he’s very knowledgeable and responsible.”“It is with pleasure & gratitude I can share this about my dear friend Harmen. Almost 10 years ago I met Harmen for the first time at an Yijing conference in The Netherlands, and then already he impressed me with his knowledge & skill of the ancient Chinese Masters. Not only that, he showed a real interest in (and understanding of) the effects & benefits of Change on life in general. Later I got to know him personally, he always was (and still is) ready with wise advise & encouragement in whatever questions I asked him. Harmen is one of those rare people who can discern the essential from the superficial, and in that way is able to get to the core of a problem or situation in a short time. And, important: with a right sense of humor! I’m really thankful I can call him “dear friend”. So, if ever you are in a situation where it is not so clear what your next step could/must be, don’t hesitate to contact him. I’m sure you also will get good advice, and who knows, perhaps a friend for life.”"
70,"The discussion about the order of the sixty-four hexagrams in the King Wen sequence has often come to the fore in recent decades (also here, in last June). Namely, are the hexagrams arranged randomly or according to a conscious design?At long last, I am through with my essay on the (assumpted) initial arrangement of the hexagrams. In this work, I believe, there are convincing arguments for the theory that the unity of opposites might have been the philosophical ground for the classification of the hexagrams well before the received (King Wen’s?) sequence.My new website still is under development but the article is readable here: https://kingwen.net.Jozsef"
71,"Here's what landed in my email inbox today.The first sentence of blurb is off-putting - so someone needs to breathe new life into Yi to make it relevant to the present day? I hadn't noticed. But the rest, and the sample (which sadly doesn't include any actual translation/interpretation) look genuinely interesting.Does anyone know the book or its author?'The Book of Changes:A Modern Adaptation and Interpretation'by Paul G. FendosMinnesota State SystemThe Book of Changes: A Modern Adaptation and Interpretation attempts to breathe new life into the Book of Changes by making it relevant to the present time and day. It does so by using archaeological evidence to trace the origins of the Book of Changes, starting with numeric trigrams and hexagrams, making its way up to early divination manuals, and ending with the oldest extant version of the Books of Changes—usually referred to as the ‘received version.’ It also explains the development of the Book of Changes from a divination manual into a philosophical text dealing with change. However, its main focus is on delineating sixty-four patterns of change in the Book of Changes, patterns based on novel metaphorical interpretations of the line texts in the Book of Changes that serve as the foundation for a new handbook on change.Each metaphorical interpretation consists of 1) a hexagram and the Chinese character associated with it, 2) a ‘description’ of the hexagram, 3) the Chinese characters for the line texts, 4) translations of the line texts, 5) a general interpretation of the line texts based on those translations, 6) and some explanatory notes that attempt to clarify each interpretation. Translations and the interpretations based on those translations reference Traditional and Modernist understandings of the line text materials, ancient texts/dictionaries/lexicons from the period when the Book of Changes was compiled, and the ideas of the author as he works to create a new Chinese ‘philosophy of change,’ complete with examples of how it can be adapted in modern-day life. The clear and concise general introduction to the Book of Changes that is incorporated into this work, the many interpretations of the line texts contained in it, and a popular philosophical content make this book a welcome addition to the field and will attract interested scholars and teachers, engage business people or those looking to better understand Chinese culture, and appeal to those focused on spirituality and holistic living.  https://vernonpress.com/book/383(12% Discount using WRFLPR12 at checkout)Click to expand..."

(I’m learning that they turn into colour-coded confetti by about mid-February.) But I have some plans for the first few months, and it occurred to me you might be wondering what’s available when. So…In January 2017 I’ll be opening for readings – the full reading service, not the smaller I Ching chats which are more or less always available (though not so much for the next couple of weeks, because Christmas). The still point round the turning of the year, the quiet before Spring, is a natural time to go deeper.I read for at most half a dozen people at a time: I’ve found that’s a good way to ensure I have plenty of time and energy to work with each reading, mull it over and follow where it leads without hurry. The first thing I do when I open is to email people who have downloaded ‘Ways of Opening’ (a guide/ helper for finding your question), so if you’d be interested in a reading in January, please download a copy now.In February 2017 I’ll start the class on Reading for Others. This will be very small, probably a ‘beta’ version (ie it’s inexpensive and participants will be involved in shaping and improving the class), since while I’ve been doing this for a (very) long time, I’ve never taught it before.I won’t start anything else while ‘Reading for Others’ is still running, but later in the year I’d really like to run a Foundations Class again. The Foundations Course is always available, of course, and if you’re part of Change Circle you can always get my help with it in Yi Academy or by phone/Skype. But that’s still not the same as being part of a class, embarking on the course together and getting to know one another along the way.

99,"(Only 'I Ching News' in the rather loose sense that Clarity's about the I Ching and it has some news…)Here's a blog post about the upcoming redesign.To elaborate a bit... bright and early tomorrow morning (UK morning, that is), Audrey-the-expert will finish moving most of the site to the new design - basically, the blog and all the pages that aren't a) forum/ WikiWing or b) your account pages. Then I will fix the home page, and switch the forum to the new style. And once that's working I will do the account pages and assorted other tweaks. And I'll publish another blog post with a guide to the new site, to make sure you can find everything with no problem.In theory, this will all go beautifully smoothly. You'll just see the forum magically change to the lovely new design without so much as a hiccup. The top and bottom of the page will look very different - new images, new menus - but the forums in the middle will work just the same way.In practice, if it all looks like a dog's dinner at first, bear with me. The new forum skin has been working nicely as a test, but since lots of files it uses will be moved, I've had to change the links to all of those - and I won't be able to see whether I've got that right until after the move. The forums will keep working, though.Similarly for your account and membership pages, except that I haven't been able to test those with the new design at all - so while they will work, they will probably look funny for a while, until they don't.If, after any obvious dogs' dinners have been tidied up, you find mistakes/ bugs/ oddities, please assume I don't know about them, and tell me! Likewise if you're not sure where something has gone, please ask.Once I've tied up any loose ends, I plan to disappear on holiday for a couple of weeks... "
100,"Yi tends to shape people’s thinking, and when it gets hold of an artist or writer the consequences can be thoroughly*interesting…I mentioned Will Buckingham’s Sixty-Four Chance Pieces once before, but I’ll happily jump on this opportunity to recommend them again. These are 64 short stories, one inspired by each hexagram,*drawing on real knowledge of and insight into Yi and a true delight to read. (And maybe to use as a divination companion, as who knows what synchronicities might open up in response?)And… I’ve just heard of a new work*that looks very interesting: Changing, by Richard Berengarten. It’s a remarkable undertaking: a poem inspired by the whole Zhouyi, line by line. Here’s a pdf sampler that includes the first two hexagrams – though we’ll need to read the whole book to discover how much he’s been able to integrate of the Yi’s own internal architecture. I look forward to it.(If you’re in Chicago, there’s a book launch and reading from Changing in the University of Chicago’s Wieboldt Hall 408 on October 3rd at*4.30pm.)The post Yi as inspiration appeared first on I Ching with Clarity."

102,"Can't use IE now with this forum at all.  Hilary said to clear cache so I did but it didn't help so the only solution is to use Chrome which I'm not happy about.  Basically the forum on my IE browser froze about 5pm yesterday, none of posts will post and no new posts appear either.  I just tried to post in the IE browser and it says I have no access to the forum.  Am I the only one who cannot use IE to access this place now ?"
103,"I’ve just opened the (virtual) doors for a new I Ching chat service…What this isA 30 minute chat on anything I-Ching-related – a line you’re stuck on, a reading where you could really use a fresh perspective, an image or hexagram that keeps coming back, even a knotty problem that you can’t seem to resolve into a simple question to ask. That kind of thing.When I let the main I Ching reading service grow to the size it seemed to want to be – a month or so of in-depth exploration with weekly calls – this left a bit of a gap if you wanted some individual help with a reading but didn’t want a month-long, deep-dive intensive. I started offering I Ching chats for Change Circle members, and since this has worked well, I’ve decided to extend the offer to everyone.How it worksFirst you book a time, then you pay, and then you’re taken to a page where you can send me the details of what you want to talk about. That seemed the best order to do it in, to ensure you don’t pay unless you’ve booked a time that suits you.On the day, I’ll call you – by phone or Skype, whichever. Skype is preferable if you have it, because the sound quality’s better, but*phone works too.Three reasons not to book an I Ching chat1. You’re completely new to the I ChingConfident expertise*isn’t required, but you do need to be reasonably familiar with casting your own readings, so we can spend our 30 minutes*focussed on what you wanted to ask about, not distracted by technical details.(Of course, if what you want to ask about is a technical detail, that’s OK!)2. You’ve got a lot going on and need comprehensive helpIf you want really in-depth help, especially if you think it might take more than one reading, then you probably need the full I Ching reading service instead. In a small chat like this, I think less is more.3. You’re a Change Circle memberIf you’re a Change Circle member, this service is included as part of your membership. So use the Change Circle booking link – not the regular shop page, which would ask you for payment after booking.*(If you're not a member, you're welcome to join*- you'll be able to access the members-only booking page*immediately.)Here are all the details and the booking link for I Ching chats. If you have any questions, please ask!"
104,"What's happening?WikiWing is the I Ching Community's collaborative 'Wing' for Yi: a hexagram-by-hexagram, line-by-line commentary, based wholly on our own experiences in divination. It started life in 2008 with my own personal notes, and has been growing steadily through the years as people add more examples.Up until now, it's only been available to members of Change Circle. I'm going to change that, and create a separate WikiWing-only membership at a lower price.Why?In a nutshell: Change Circle is on its way to becoming the 'home' to all my courses and Yi-learning materials. Once complete, that'll mean putting its price up for new members - which would mean new people could only join and contribute to WikiWing by paying the higher price. That's not - at all - the idea behind it, so now feels like the right time to open WikiWing as something you can join on its own, to read and contribute.(To clarify - WikiWing will still be part of Change Circle, too. Change Circle people please note, you do not need to join it separately!)How?This isn't ready yet, but as soon as it is, there will be plenty of prominent links inviting you to join. You won't be able to miss it.To guarantee that this is affordable, I'm going to go out on a limb and try 'Pay What You Want' pricing. The best business advice says this is risky in general, and especially daft for a recurring subscription, but Yi is very encouraging, so here we go.WikiWing access - to both read and contribute - will be available as a monthly subscription. Pay what you want - what feels right to you. (The minimum monthly payment will be £1.)When?Soon! I've had to commission a new add-on to handle the 'pay what you want' subscription... that arrived this morning... and has a bug. So I need to get that fixed, and sort a couple of other technical things, and write some 'how to edit' help. If all goes well, I should be able to open the doors within 2 weeks....?(space for further questions below this post...)"

108,"Short version: here it is, with my apologies. (I didn’t know anyone still used it!)Backstory:A few years*ago I commissioned Ewald Berkers*(creator of the I Ching Community’s indispensable hexagram search) to make us a new online I Ching.I did so because the old reading, the one in two frames, created a lot of confusion for beginners. It always shows two hexagrams even when you’ve only cast one, so people get*the impression that*that an unchanging hexagram is*‘casting the same hexagram twice’. And it displays*the complete changing line texts of both hexagrams, leaving newcomers far from sure what’s actually part of their answer.The new reading*cleared up the confusion: an unchanging hexagram just appears as one hexagram, and only the relevant text is displayed. Also, since it casts one line at a time and displays the answer on a new page, it’s just a little slower to use, which in my book is a Good Thing. (And it*can be saved and exported to pdf and linked to…)I left the old frames reading around in case anyone wanted to use it, though I didn’t really expect anyone would. And then when I created the redesigned site, I called on Ewald again to make his reading script work with it (as a WordPress plugin)… and pretty much forgot the two-pane*reading still existed.Well… I live and learn…I’ve already had about 20 requests to put the old reading back. So, in response to popular demand, here it is. Restyled a little*to match the new site, and with the links corrected, but otherwise unchanged.I’ve included a link to this on the main free reading page*– tucked away at the bottom, under the ‘introduction for beginners’."
109,"or ‘Where did Hilary go?’For the last several months, I’ve been working on redesigning the website – which has been so time-consuming that really only Change Circle members have seen much of me. It has all taken just a bit longer than expected…But*we are almost there. All that’s left to do is the actual changeover to the new design. This is a bit more complicated than it sounds, so I’m getting a tremendously helpful expert to do the heavy lifting.What to expect on Saturday…Saturday 23rd*is Changeover Day, and there will be some odd moments: bits of the site looking different from other bits, links that lead nowhere, and so on. But everything should be working again normally within 48 hours or so. First the blog, then the main site, then the forums and finally your*‘account’ and ‘profile’ pages will be changed to the new design.…and afterwardsI expect I’ll spend the following*few-days-to-a-week doing the remaining technical chores and chasing down any unexpected bugs. (Just imagine me staggering blearily*about, waving a fly swatter.) If you could let me know about any issues you find during this time, that would be brilliant – thank you.And then I’m going to have a holiday. Not something I*normally do, but I think I need one. (Error 404, brain not found. Error 418*is also a distinct possibility.)And*then, when I’m back, I’ll invite you to have a look at the new ‘I Ching chat’ option. This is a quite different animal from the full reading service: it’s just a thirty minute chat to help you get ‘unstuck’ on a specific reading sticking point. The same service has been included in Change Circle for a while now, and*since that’s worked well, I thought I’d try making it generally available. More information coming with the new site…"
110,"As you can see… we have a new Clarity website. I really hope you like it! Here’s an explanation of the changes and a guide to the new site.Why change the design?Because the old one was old *– some nine years old, in fact – which means it wasn’t at all adapted for browsing on smartphones/ tablets. (You may have found it disappeared from Google search results on your phone – that would be why.) So that had to change… and while I was working on that, I’ve also tried to make it look a bit less like 2007.In the process I get to do something I always wanted: fill the site with images of the natural world, showing what Yi is and what it’s made of. When I started out, ‘site full of images’ meant ‘site no-one can actually load over their dial-up connection’ – but times have changed, and there’s no need for a site about the Yi to look like a site about a bank.The new header image shows the sun emerging from behind clouds – which is (probably) what the Chinese character yi*originally represented. Yi is change as in ‘a change in the weather’ and ‘the emergence of light’ – something I didn’t yet know in 2000 when I named the business ‘Clarity’.‘Life can be translucent’, says the header. That’s my idea of what Yi does – it opens up ordinary life so meaning shines through.What’s changed?Content-wise…Not a huge amount has changed. What I’ve done is to move things round and consolidate all the learning material in one place. So instead of a private free course for members and a bunch of public pages that sort-of more-or-less duplicate its material, there is a single free beginner’s course. You’ll find it (unsurprisingly) under ‘Learn’.There are still bonuses for free members. The difference: you don’t have to seek out a separate download area to find them, you only need to be logged in when you look at the course pages. On the same page, people who haven’t joined (or aren’t logged in) will see messages saying ‘Sign up to get this download’, while as a member you’ll just see a link to download it.If you’re on any page and not seeing what you think you should (eg if you’re a Change Circle member not seeing the full Foundations Course), click ‘log in’ at the top right.You’ll be redirected back to the same page afterwards, now displaying the right version for you.Navigation-wise…You no longer have to click over to ‘Learn’ to see what’s available there. Any main page is available from any other page – just mouseover/ tap on the main menu.Site search is also available directly from the main menu, and so is a contact form under ‘About –That’s on every page except the forum, where you’ll just see a link to the contact page.*Please use one of these if/when you find bugs!Finding forum thingsMouseover/ tap on ‘Community’. Here you’ll find a complete list of forums and – once you’re logged in – the forum search options, notifications, private messages and links to profile and settings. On a computer, you mouseover and then click what you want; on mobile, you tap a submenu to open it and then a link to access it.So everything that was under the ‘Talk’ tab is here, and so is most of what you used to access by clicking the ‘account’ link in the top right-hand corner. The exception to that: the log in form and the link to your main account page for Clarity as a whole (not just the forums) are still at the top right:Go to the ‘Your Account’ link at the top right if you want to –*see everything you’ve purchasedchange your passwordchange your registered email address (for forum notifications and product orders)change your username (that’s for future*posts – it won’t affect what’s displayed on your previous posts)delete your whole account at Clarity*Use the ‘Forum settings’ link under the ‘Community’ menu if you want to –*tweak how you appear on the forum – profile picture, the avatar by your posts, etcchange your forum signaturechange any of your forum preferences: skin, subscriptions, friends, private messaging etcaccess your bookmarks (CC members)To access what you’ve purchased…Log in, and then –You can look under the relevant tab: access Reading Circle, WikiWing, Yi Academy etc via the ‘Community’ menu; access the Foundations Course via ‘Learn’ and the ‘Treasure Chest’ extra articles via Learn > More tools – or from the ‘Change Circle’ home page under ‘Community’.You can also click ‘Your Account’ in the top-right hand corner of every page for… well… your account, which includes a list of direct links to ‘active resources’.Using the forum on your phone/ tabletI’ve had the menu adapted to be mobile-responsive in the forums too, so you may be quite happy using the forum just as it is. But if you’d prefer something simpler, there is a mobile skin you can choose as your default instead. To try it –At the bottom of the ‘Community’ menu, tap ‘Forum settings’In the left-hand menu under ‘My Account’ tap ‘General settings’In the very last section of this page, ‘Miscellaneous options’, you’ll find a dropdown menu for ‘forum skin’. Change that to ‘default mobile style’ and tap ‘save’ at the bottom of the page.This gives you a rudimentary, very quick and simple version of the forum: no links to the rest of the site, no ‘post thanks’, no settings page or hexagram search. Its main menu is the blue square grid icon at the top right.To change back, click ‘full site’ at the bottom of any forum page, and then make your way back to the settings page again to switch your default skin.If you find a bug…Then please oh please let me know. Click ‘About’ in the main menu and try out that nice, new contact form! Or visit this page at the forum*where kind people are already posting about bugs/ questions."

125,"This picture has been going around a while but I think it is important enough to have it filed in this forum.http://www.yjcn.nl/images/shifa.jpg (warning: large image)From the Qinghua bamboo manuscripts (http://now.dartmouth.edu/2013/05/tsinghua-bamboo-manuscripts-offer-clues-about-early-china/). It shows the trigrams connected to the human body, as known from the 說卦. The Qinghua documents have the same style of writing as the Shanghai manuscripts and the Guodian manuscripts and are probably from around the same date, 300 BC. It would be the oldest trigram circle found in Chinese history, and the oldest link of the trigrams connected to the body. It is published in 《清華大學藏戰國竹簡（肆）》. The Shifa 筮法 manuscript also links the Houtian Bagua 後天八卦 with the shuzigua 數字卦, the numerical 'hexagrams' that Zhang Zhenglang wrote about (see here for more info). The Shifa manuscript marks a phase in the development of the Zhouyi from a numerical system to a more symbolic system in which numbers are less important. The commentary to the 'hexagrams' in the Shifa manuscript show how they are interpreted. I expect more publications about the Shifa manuscript this year."

128," I’ve been blessed with some wonderful reading clients over the past year, and I’m hugely grateful for the experience. I’ve witnessed clarity dawning, knots untying themselves, blocks dissolving – Yi at work. I love it. And… I realise there’s something I need to tweak a bit to create more space for the reading to happen.Four things I’ve found work really well: Readings in conversation*– by Skype or phone – because readings actually are*a conversation, not a monologue, so a real-life conversation turns out to be their natural element. (If you can’t have a spoken conversation we can use text chat, and if that’s not possible we’ll work out a way to do this by email – but still as a conversation, not an essay!)The opening call*to discuss the background and find the question. Last time around, I had someone email me the day after his opening call to say that now he knew the question, he found he also knew the answer, so could we cancel the reading? We did. There’s magic just in knowing the question you’re truly asking. Then you can begin to see how it’s being answered – by a Yijing reading, and in other ways.The month-long shared exploration*of the reading, with the review call at the end. This gives us more time to reflect and get deeper into the reading – I ‘carry’ it with me and keep my eyes and ears open for new insights – and creates a space where we can experience the reading doing its work. And also…The integrating questions*– ridiculously tiny little emails, just a question or two, that spark substantial insights. I especially enjoy it when a client emails me back in response to these and we can get into conversation.Two things I’ve found could be better, that I want to change: Squeezing the whole reading into one call. Yes, if we take the full 90 minutes I can cover all the essentials, but a) I’m going through thinking, ‘Oh, no time, better leave that part out for now’ and b) the client sometimes senses the pressure of how much there is to communicate and starts apologising for interrupting*me, which is ridiculous because whose reading is it anyway?*and c) the whole thing can feel like a giant information-dump. That’s especially true if you’re completely new to Yi, not familiar with the basic structure (hexagrams, changing lines etc) – but really, even if you know Yi well, there is just so much*in a reading. During the month that follows I’ll email some of the parts I missed on the call, but this really isn’t as good as talking about them – and then when we speak again for the review call I’m quite often left thinking, ‘I wish I’d included that, it would have been really helpful!’ Which is daft, because it wouldn’t have been helpful at all – it would have been entirely lost in the flood.Limiting it to just one reading. 99.98% of the time this works beautifully – as a rule, the questions you have about a reading are all answered by that reading – but sometimes there is a complementary question that obviously needs asking. Or sometimes Yi’s answer to the first question may*forcefully redirect you to ask something else. In these cases, it’s silly to be stuck with just one. Also, I sometimes find myself on an opening call working to dispel a sense of artificial pressure to find the ‘One Right Question’.So… here is how the newly-tweaked readings will look when I open in a few days’ time: We start the same way –you download the ‘Ways of Opening’ pdf (see the bottom of this page) and use it to reflect on your question, and then we talk and then you decide whether to go ahead with a reading  And then…in our first reading call we cover the essentials of the reading and I’ll still send you the ‘integrating questions’ emails because people have repeatedly told me how valuable those are but we’ll also*have four*further weekly calls*for deeper exploration of the reading, to talk about how it applies and how you can use it in the moment, to answer your questions, and also to discuss (and if necessary ask Yi) any related questions that come up.  So there will be more space and time to explore: you’ll have a clear sense of the framework and core message of the reading and be able to relate to and use its insights within that context. The price for this expanded reading service will be £200 – or £150 for Change Circle members – or four instalments of £52. A final note: while this post is about the reading service I offer, you can also ‘rewrite’ it to be about what you can offer yourself*when you cast a reading. A long journalling session to find the question you’re truly asking (the ‘Ways of Opening’ download is free)… an hour or so set aside to reflect on the reading… time in your calendar*to come back to it and see how it connects into your unfolding experience, and so on. Not every reading calls for this kind of deep exploration, of course – but when one does, give it space to unfold."

133,"Maybe it's because I lost my poetic license. Maybe I'm just old and set in my ways.

Exact the proper punishments and you'll bring forth wild bounty.""Bollocks.To add insult to injury he uses Wade-Giles wherever there is Chinese to transliterate. Why not use Legge's system?

137,"Where I start from…Yi is pretty extraordinary.I know, this isn’t exactly breaking news. But I keep noticing it all over again: partly because I keep looking at more complex structures and finding more meaning and beauty than ever (the fractal oracle?); partly because I’ve been looking more at the simplest questions (like ‘why do these lines embody this concept?’) and finding myself completely overwhelmed; and mostly simply because I see it at work in readings.Yi engages people in real conversation. It offers not only answers to questions, but a deep awareness of being truly connected. When you have confidence in your readings, so you know from experience that something as random as tossed coins or shuffled stalks will speak to you personally – well, then you know you’re fully at home. In the end, the conversation isn’t only a Q-&-A, to-and-fro: it’s a state of being.So… the ever-present question for Clarity is how I can help people towards this experience. I write stuff, I sometimes do individual readings, I help develop and sell the Resonance Journal, I provide courses and classes – always based wholly on personal readings, because there is no way to learn the art of conversation with Yi except by talking with it (also not news!) – and I run Change Circle.Change Circle is for people who want to get into this conversation and explore it together – something that’s easier to do freely in a private space, where you don’t have Google looking over your shoulder indexing every word! It’s also a natural place for study, because if you’re interested in going deeper with Yi then you’re also interested in learning more about it – that’s almost tautological.Which is fine… except that it’s left me spreading myself rather thin, trying to look after course or class people in one place and Change Circle people somewhere else. Balls get dropped. *And it occurs to me that I’m creating a lot of unnecessary complication.So I decided –I’ll give everything to Change Circle peopleStarting with*the new Foundations Course, and continuing with all the Yijing learning materials I create in future (modules on more advanced techniques are in the works), everything to do with learning Yijing divination will be included in Change Circle membership.You won’t have to decide between membership or a course or an ebook – you just come in under the Change Circle roof and find it all waiting for you there, with as much or as little support as you want, from me and the community as a whole. Reading Circle, WikiWing, the Foundations Course and its forum, more advanced modules to come (developed inside the Wiki so you can access them as works in progress), and the option of chatting with me for half an hour each month about any Yi-related puzzles you may have.What the changes will look likeThe course I currently have on sale is going into an honourable retirement; the Foundations Course is just better all round. (As well it should be – it’d be pretty sad if I couldn’t produce something better now than I wrote about a decade ago…) The ‘Words of Change’ mini-glossary will be retired, too, because the enlarged-and-improved Language of Change is also available inside Change Circle.So the Clarity ‘shop’ will contain:personal readings (sometimes) for £150the Resonance Journal – still*only £20!the Foundations Course on its own (for anyone who’s completely allergic to forums and tutoring and just wants to study on their own) for £50WikiWing membership – pay what you want, starting at all of £1/monththe newly expanded*Change Circle membership*– pay what you want, starting at £10/month(Later, I’ll add a special version of Change Circle membership with personal support/ tuition for a limited number of people. Later still, as I complete the more advanced course, I’ll probably raise the price of basic membership. And one day I’d also very much like to provide*tuition, support and certification for people who want to read for others professionally.)When they’ll happen: 1st September– or as close to that date as I can. (Technology may happen to me at any stage, of course. It often does.)Why I’m telling you this nowBecause the price of Change Circle is going up substantially to reflect all the new additions – it’s currently £40/year – and existing members will be ‘grandfathered’ in at the original price while still having full access to everything. Whatever price you pay when you sign up for Change Circle is the price you will continue to pay for as long as you remain a member.So… you might want to join now. Or ask me any questions you have to help you decide whether to join now.Last edited: Aug 15, 2015"
138,"I’m really the wrong person to review this book: it’s a scholarly work, and I’m not remotely qualified to write a scholarly review. So here is a diviner’s take, instead. It comes as a sort of ‘whinge sandwich': appreciation beginning and end, nitpicking in the middle. (Don’t take too much notice of the filling; it’s a lovely book.)Wonderful scholarship…First, as a diviner, it’s good to be able to rely on someone else’s scholarship! Better background knowledge makes for better readings. And Stephen Field undoubtedly knows his ancient Chinese onions. I have two other books of his – the fascinating/bewildering Tian Wen and Ancient Chinese Divination. This book, like those, is one from which I can learn a lot.This starts with the introduction. Its table of contents is available as a pdf from the publisher’s page – and yes, any self-respecting Yeek will be salivating over this, and rightly so. The section on the bagua is especially fascinating. (The Luoshu writing representing calendar reform following the precession of the equinoxes, for instance, with the turtle as a constellation emerging from the ‘river’ of the Milky Way…) There’s a wealth of information here – historical and cultural background – that I’ve not found elsewhere, not even in Rutt’s introduction.The learning continues with the hexagrams, and especially with the stories behind them. Just a few highlights:historical ‘who’s who’ clarity in Hexagram 54a much fuller version of the story of Wang Hai, anti-hero of hexagrams 34 and 56. Interestingly, Field tells his story first under Hexagram 23, which he thinks refers to Hai’s dismembering.in Hexagram 35, a detailed account of the story of Kang and his reward, and a clear connection with the ‘royal mother’ of line 2In addition to these specific references, there’s also an underlying awareness of the authors’ culture and way of life. So we learn that the ‘thatch grass’ of 11.1 was also used to wrap offerings, that bronze was equivalent to gold and therefore a natural reward for the successful hunters – and there’s the clearest differentiation I’ve seen yet of the coloured knee-bands in 47.2 and .5.…and so on - more examples of this abundant food for thought later……but uninspiring interpretationIt’s not that Field is uninterested in divination, I think. Part 3 of the book is boldly-titled ‘practical applications’, and begins with recommendations for respectful ritual around the oracle book. Also, the question advice he gives is very sensible, and there’s a very full account of how to cast. (He gives three casting methods: yarrow, 3 coin and ‘8 coin’ – a modern method that always gives one changing line, also popularised recently by Karcher.)Under ‘how to interpret a reading’ he tells you not how to interpret a reading, but which texts to read: ignore moving line texts altogether when there’s more than one line changing and read the hexagram judgements; with one line changing, read just that line and ignore the hexagram judgements. Not brilliant advice if you’re interested in the full subtle language of the Yi, but not disastrous if you want a simple answer.So he does care about divination – but the book doesn’t reliably offer you usable interpretations that will deepen your understanding of a reading. Which is a shame – I would have loved commentaries that offered more insight into Yi’s nature as an oracle, a way to have powerful conversations that create change. I don’t mean commentary to ‘tell you what it means’ (ugh), but I do think it’s the interpreter’s job to draw out the connections that hold the text together and give you a sense of the hexagram’s underlying theme. That often doesn’t happen in Field’s book – it’s as if he doesn’t believe in a deeper theme at all.Take the commentary on Hexagram 3’s name and judgement, for instance:3. Tun, A BunchWhen pronounced tun, the name of this hexagram means “to accumulate,” or “to tie together (in bunches).” Note line 5 where this meaning is especially evident. When pronouncedzhun, the graph means “difficult” and pictures a sprout before it breaks through the soil.Hexagram statement: Diviners in the early history of this text determined that travel conducted as a result of this hexagram usually ended in misfortune. So they recorded the counsel, “Do not use this omen to go on a journey.” Similarly, when the king divined the proper time to enfeoff his nobles and this hexagram was obtained, the result was usually favorable. So the diviners recorded the counsel, “It is good to install feudal officers.”​Is that really how he thinks the text was assembled? Just random jottings of divination experiences? Isn’t there some significance to the contrast between enfeoffment and going on a journey, and some relationship between that and the name of the hexagram?Another example: he translates Hexagram 30 as not ‘clarity’ but ‘lia bird’, and has some very interesting information about this bird. So…why would this one hexagram of the 64 recommend rearing cattle in its Judgement? Because ‘diviners in the early history of this text determined that keeping cows brought good fortune.’ There is no suggestion of any connection between the lia bird and cattle-rearing – it looks as though he’s chosen the translation for the hexagram name with no thought to its relation to its context. Which is the only sensible way to go about it, of course, if you believe that the text of the hexagram is nothing but a random collection of diviners’ records with no unifying theme…An oracle, or some records of an oracle?It’s important to recognise that diviners’ records certainly are and always have been part of how we understand hexagrams. It’s a tradition as old as the oracle. We’re part of it now: when you want help with a reading, you may well come to the forum to ask, ‘Does anyone have experience with these two lines changing?’ (And this is why we’re building WikiWing – a collaborative ‘eleventh Wing’ of distilled reading experiences) Field represents the very beginning of the same tradition by dividing the text into three columns: omen, counsel and fortune. For instance, 30.3:Omen:  the setting sun’s lia-birdCounsel: Unless you beat an earthen pot and sing, your elders’ lamentations will be substantial.Fortune: Misfortune.​(The commentary has a really intriguing suggestion: this bird could be the three legged raven seen in the sun, in sunspots – visible to the naked eye at sunset – and you must beat on pots and sing to drive the raven away.)The idea is that the original diviners see a sign, then record their experience or compose an interpretation in response, and make a note of how good or bad the outcome was. In a way, it’s interesting to see the text broken up in this way – it’s good to have a clear visual reminder of which parts are missing, because the absence of a ‘fortune’ from a line, for instance, can be quite eloquent.However, it’s not especially easy to read in the correct order (you have to remember to read across the columns, then down), and in fact the text isn’t always given in the correct order – in hexagram 4, the second half of the ‘fortune’, ‘a good omen’ (aka ‘constancy bears fruit’), should come at the very end, after the questioner’s importunate interruption. That – I reckon – is a deliberate literary device, so that the questioner interrupts omen words that are normally spoken together. (I don’t suppose Field believes such things are to be found in Yi.)Anyway… divination records are certainly used as part of the Yi’s construction. But they are used, not just collected. The book was composed for use as an oracle, so I think it’s reasonable to credit its authors with some thoughtfulness and insight as they selected the dozen or so characters to sum up the essence of tun or li.Whereas if you treat the book mostly as just a compilation of historical allusions and divination records – rather than something intended for future use as an oracle – you risk missing the point.The lines of Hexagram 18, for instance, are written following the ancient pattern of divinations to ask which neglected ancestral spirit was responsible for a curse: ‘it is stem father x’s curse’. But in the text of the Yi, the names of the ancestors are all omitted. Field spends some time pondering which ancestor they might mean – when surely, if the authors had meant those who received this hexagram in divination to use it to identify a Zhou ancestor as the source of their problems, they could simply have left the names in? Perhaps they had something else in mind?Also, if you treat the book as an oracle, then a line’s good or bad omens must be part of the line. That is, omen, counsel and fortune work together to say, ‘in this situation, acting this way is a good/ bad idea.’ But if this isn’t your starting point – if you don’t expect a line to carry that kind of message – then things start coming apart.A couple of examples: 29.6 and 53.5.29.6:‘Tie him up with braids and cords. Throw him into a thorny keep. For three years he is not bagged. Misfortune.’​In his commentary, Field develops the idea that the lines of 29 concern the imprisonment of Wen (then known as Chang). Of line 6 he says,This omen shows the captive tied up with braids and cords and thrown into a thorny enclosure. The counsel attests that the captive will not be “bagged” (that is, converted) for three years. While the omen is bad, the implication is not. After three painful years, the prisoner is still not broken. Eventually – after three more years, Chang was released from prison.​‘While the omen is bad, the implication is not.’ That makes sense for a historical record – not for an oracle. (Oh… except for in lines like 28.6… but that’s a special case.)In 53.5, the disjointedness extends to the translation. A ‘conventional’ one:‘The wild geese gradually progress to the ancestral grave-mounds.The wife is not pregnant for three years.In the end, nothing can prevent it.Good fortune.’​You see the logic: it’s good fortune because the wife will certainly become pregnant in the end.Field:‘The wild goose reaches the hills. The wife will not conceive for three years. In the end no one can overcome it. Good fortune.’​The wife will never conceive – so where is the ‘good fortune’ coming from? Perhaps his commentary will explain…‘This omen shows a wild goose flying even higher to the hill. Another ominous scenario similar to those in line 3 is presented in the counsel text here. A wife is deprived of her future child when she is unable to conceive for three years. However, in this line the woman is unable to overcome her barrenness – perhaps a reference to the daughter of King Di Yi. Otherwise, the counsel refers to the hunters who are unable to bag the goose. Whichever is the case, the prognosis is good fortune.’​…or perhaps not. (Now a failed hunt is good fortune, too?) Anyway, this shows what a difference the translator’s idea of the book makes: if you don’t start with the assumption that the text is meant to be used as an oracle, then the line doesn’t need to hang together as a coherent answer to a prospective questioner.But this gets us into the realms of literary criticism and how each of us ‘constructs’ the text – hard to imagine there could be any book more de- and re-constructed than this one – which is something I was very pleased to escape 19 years ago. Moving on……more to nitpick aboutWhile I’m in complaining mode – I wish he’d consider translating fu as something other than ‘captives’. He does concede this once, at 14.5: ‘His confidence was mutual and awe-inspiring.’ He says firmly in the notes to this line that ‘this instance is the only one that retains the original meaning of “trust” or “confidence”.’I imagine he allows this exception because he has associated Hexagram 14 with the Duke of Zhou and his willingness to sacrifice himself for King Wu, and there are no captives in this story. So 厥孚交如威如 – ‘hisfu mingling thus awe-inspiring thus’ becomes confidence that is mutual and awe-inspiring. When I saw this, I turned with interest to 37.6, 有孚威如 – ‘having fu awe-inspiring thus’ to see if the same phrase would be translated in the same way. But no – no awe-inspiring confidence here, just ‘captives terror-stricken’. Which, as translation of the same words, seems odd.So Hexagram 61 has to be called ‘score the capture’ rather than anything like ‘central trust’. Yet when he reaches the poetry of line 2, the crane calling and her young answering, he actually writes,The image of this omen text is an appropriate representation of the original meaning of fu, “hatchling,” noted under the hexagram name above. A derived meaning of “hatchling” is “confidence” – the fragile chicks have total trust and dependence on the hen that hatches them. Here, it is a symbol of allegiance…​Lovely! Perfect! (Then isn’t there the smallest possibility that the name of the hexagram could mean something more than ‘score the capture’?)And a final complaint for good measure – I wish the Harrassowitz Verlag could afford a proof reader. We have, for instance, one ‘sacrificial alter’ and at 19.6 ‘Ernest wailing.’ (Whatever can have upset the poor man?) Gah.But a real feast of food for thoughtThe publishers say, “The general public will appreciate the narrative cohesion of the commentaries.” This member of it certainly does. Field tells stories with the hexagram lines, and many of these are of the eye-opening, ‘why did I never think of that?’ variety. 9.6, for instance: it’s a bad omen for the wife because her husband will go to war. Ah. (Though the lines of 9 – ‘Lesser Stock’ – are mostly about goats.)Also, he regularly makes many lines in a hexagram tell one story. 63 lines 1, 2 and 4 all describe one carriage that gets temporarily stuck on a sandbar. Hexagram 40 lines 2-6 all tell the story of a hunting party waylaid by bandits. There are many more examples, and this generally works very well – I can see it coming in highly useful in readings with multiple moving lines for finding connections between them.Admirers of LiSe’s work will be interested to know that Field agrees with her on 15, actually translating the hexagram name as ‘the wedwing': the bird that has to join with its partner to fly. (He goes on to associate this with the combined efforts of Wen and Wu, necessary to achieve the ‘completion’ of conquering Shang.)Field is particularly good at pointing to mythical and historical references in the text, backing this up with his in-depth knowledge of the myth/history. There’s a wealth of detail about stories we already know from other sources (Wang Hai, Wu at Feng, Prince Kang, Yu) and also associations and allusions I’ve not come across elsewhere, or not in anything like this kind of detail. 46 as a migration in early Zhou history? 57 as the story of Wu’s illness?Some of these associations are more convincing than others (what is there, really, to tell us that 8.6 is – definitely – about Fa making alliances after his father’s death?) but it’s all deeply intriguing and makes me look at the familiar words in a new way.There is so much good stuff in here: the details of Hai and Heng in Hexagram 34; the specific conquest and post-conquest history in the lines of 50; ceremonies to ward off the evil of an earthquake in 51; 28 and 62 as ‘the old surpass’ and ‘the young surpass’ respectively, with 62 as the story of funeral, succession and inheritance. That last really fits well with the theme of the hexagram as I understand it: smallness in the face of great things, like ancestral might and virtue (didn’t Wu habitually refer to himself in speeches as ‘the small child’?), and the importance of facing, meeting and ‘getting the message’ from such encounters.In the end, this book feels a bit like reading a wonderfully well-researched, in-depth and thoughtful biography of a close friend. I’m not sure whether the biographer has ever met my friend, but that doesn’t matter – I still want to read and re-read the biography.Who’s this book for?Not for beginners, I think – not for people who haven’t already settled into a relationship with Yi and a pattern of divination. (It would be a shame for a beginner to start with the fragmented ‘divination records’ view of the text, or with divination methods that restrict them to only ever reading one moving line.) And probably not for people who just want to get a reading they can use, maybe with a few helpful nudges for interpretation. This is one for Yeeks – dedicated students who love the oracle, are happy comparing translations and want to dive deep. If you’re interested in building up your reserve of stories and background knowledge from which to extemporise your own interpretations – just like those ancient diviners – then buy this one, and enjoy.Where to get itAmazon UKAmazon USLast edited: Aug 9, 2015"

Here’s what’s going on…First, there is a new version of the Resonance Journal. If you haven’t looked at it for a while, the main difference you will find is that it now installs seamlessly (no fussing with java) and will add a shortcut to your journal on your desktop – which you can drag to your taskbar, for ease of access –Also, the copying errors in my translation/commentary and LiSe’s have been corrected, and there’s a new option to restrict the quick ‘filter’ search to tags only, which will speed up the search in larger journals.

143,"I was rummaging today and picked up some I Ching books in a charity shop. I actually got a new Wilhelm and a beautiful one in Chinese with pictures for each hexagram - some are missing.  I got the I Ching for a New Age (£1) just to see Published by Benson in 2002I realise now the widely different translations - the book seems to take a completely different stance - I would be very confused if it was my only one. I am sure that time and effort were put in but it is just one take on the hexagrams. I have put one of the pictures of 47 on the kitchen wall - it shows a red river with some people in a boat that look as if they are in a cage being bobbed about on the river (which is red). The river has a dam across it. A tree is growing in a cave at the side. Confined ... My son said the hexagram 47 on the kitchen wall made him anxious.

147,"Dear All,This question may have been answered long ago with so many threads on this forum; however so far I haven't been able to find a satisfying answer and as a newbie I hope you forgive me should I be asking again  Also I'd like to apologize upfront should I have posted this thread in the wrong place and please feel free to move it where it fits most.I'm very appreciative about this forum, which I became a member of last September when going through a rough patch. Probably times of difficulty signify when most people turn to means like the Yi Ying, Tarot, etc. Now, nearly six month down the line, and life being on the up again, I'm still consulting the Yi regularly and it's helping me tremendously to listen to my true inner voice.In the beginning I mostly used this site for translations and interpretations and still do use it often. As an English based forum I used the translations given which are Hillary's, Wilhelm/Baynes and Legge. Later on I started to use LiSe's website and downloaded the books from Bradford for look-up when what ever was presented did not make any sense to me. Later I realized that I had a German version of Wilhelm sitting on a bookshelf ... And because unfortunately my knowledge about Chinese is non-existent I started to study the German version more closely as he was one of the first Westerners to make an effort to translate the Yi. I understand that Baynes took the German version and translated it into English, correct? Could it be that her translation is not translated all that well? And that her translations already carry her interpretation of the texts even in the image, judgement and lines and that basic linguistic mistakes were made by choosing the wording she chose at the time of translation? (Btw I'm not German, but studied German linguistics).As an example I would like to offer hex. 37. In English: The Family, whereby the German translation by Wilhelm is called ""Die Sippe"". Die Sippe represents a clan, especially at the time Wilhelm translated the Yi.(meaning the entire family in the father's lineage). In 37.2 the English speaks of ""she"" whereby Wilhelm's sie is referring to ""die Sippe..."". which is plural and can be easily mistaken for the singular ""sie"" meaning she. The same for hex. 8 Union/das Zusammenhalten where for instance:8.1Hold to him in truth and loyalty;This is without blame.Truth, like a full earthen bowl;Thus in the endGood fortune comes from without.Is in German:8.1Halte wahr und treu zu ihm: das ist kein Makel.Wahrheit wie eine volle Tonschüssel:so kommt schließlich von außen her das Heil.Ihm is referring to das Zusammenhalten (Union). Now I don't know about the gender of the noun union in English though ... If I would have to translate 8.1 from German into English it would read:Stick truthfully and loyal to the unionTruth is like a full earthen bowlAs good fortune is filled by/from the outside in.(I apologize if this is rather crooked English , as English is also not my mother's tongue)Maybe I'm looking at this too much from a linguistic point of view and any comment on this would be highly appreciated.Take good care and looking forward hearing and learning from you!"

The first will be in March, and I’m thinking of starting with a class for absolute beginners – though that depends on whether there’s sufficient demand. I’ll send an email to ‘Friends’ Notes’ subscribers soon to ask for your advice and help to design this and future classes. (I just need to create a survey that asks all I need to ask without being stupidly long!) I’ve pencilled in more advanced classes for June and September – it all depends on what people are interested in – and I expect to fit in at least one more opening for individual readings inbetween the classes.*Each class will be for a small-ish group of maybe 20 people, and Change Circle members will have first claim on places (and a discount).Readings I’ll open for readings at least once more this year. Exactly when depends on energy levels and other circumstances, so I won’t promise a date for those.Change Circle, er, changes Well, no very enormous changes: we still have the private forum, Reading Circle (for posts you would rather not share with Google), and WikiWing, the experienced-based, member-created hexagram-by-hexagram commentary. And assorted useful downloads, discounts and such-like. I very much appreciate (and depend on!) Change Circle members’ ongoing support, so I keep looking for ways to show it. This year we’re trying*something new, where I’m available for 20 minute personal Skype/phone chats each week for any Yi-related questions. These are on Saturdays during February, starting on the 7th. (Details and booking link are here.) Also, WikiWing is expanding – I’m adding articles on different parts of the ‘diviner’s toolkit’ (like pairs, nuclears and so on) which we can fill out with more examples and experiences over the coming months.

152,"Introducing My ChingI Ching journal programs it seems, are like buses. You wait ages for one, and then several come along at once. In addition to the Resonance software from onlineclarity, people might also like to consider My Ching, a new software journal developed by Finnian Reilly. A trial version for Windows is available for download from the websitehttp://myching.coA short summary of features is as follows:Search EngineMy Ching is designed to feel like using a web browser. You access all your readings using a search engine. Clicking on a search result opens it in a new tab. Besides doing simple text searches, the search engine also has some very sophisticated ways of searching for hexagram characteristics.HexagramsThere are various ways to enter hexagrams, either manually, or using software assisted methods. Besides the basic reading hexagram, there is also an option to display advanced hexagram perspectives. The appearance of the hexagrams are configurable according to the users preference.Page AppearanceThe reading pages can have a number of different appearances depending on the visual theme selected in the preferences. There are 7 built in themes, and you can also create your own unique theme quite easily. See myching.co for some examples.TranslationsMy Ching does not provide any built-in I Ching translation, however right-clicking on any hexagram brings up a list of a dozen online-resource links specific to that hexagram. Clicking on a link will open the resource web page in a new tab. The resources include various translations, commentaries, interpretations etc. These resources will be constantly kept updated.PlatformsMy Ching is designed for Windows and Linux PC's. Later next year we plan to have a version for Mac OSX as well.ImportImport readings from a number of other journal products.SubscriptionMy Ching will be available for purchase on a subscription basis with discounts for volume purchase.Last edited: Nov 14, 2014"

The core idea of the software is that dreams, Yijing readings,  journalling and insights are all part of the same conversation, and so  they all belong together. Hence you should have a way to store, search  and explore them together – and that’s what this will be. A simple tag  cloud, a Yijing cast history, and an ‘advanced search’ with specialised  Yi-features make it possible to discover a lot of hidden connections.And yes – it is for both Windows and Mac.For updates and templatesPlease sign up here - http://www.onlineClarity.co.uk/journal/  - so I can keep you informed, and also send you some text templates you can use to import all your entries (readings, dreams, synchronicities and general entries) in one go, come October.If you have questions, please ask!(*The finish date is subject to the project’s chief ((and only)) programmer’s house-move going as planned.

Unlike the other books, I Ching is a book providing method of predicting the future. Because of this, it is full of mystery in people’s eyes. But at the same time, few people know I Ching well, because it was written in Classical Chinese, which is different from any modern spoken form of Chinese.

158,"Last time I was in Buenos Aires sorting out my Grandaunt's bookcase, totally by chance, I came across an 1882 edition of James Legge's ""Yi King."" It's a quaint, old, hefty chap which I love to carry about (or rather schlepp about) to read whenever chance presents itself. I've tried to incorporate it into my readings but I don't find it quite user-friendly. Two months later it has sort of grown into me but I still come out of it rather empty-handed. It's like a Wilhelm stripped down to basics. I also find Legge's rather stand-offish comments about the Ying offputting.But then, it has also taught me to concentrate in essentials. I have read so many interpretation books on the Yi that it's refreshing to actually get to read the basic translation, with warts and all, as the purists will point out. It helps me narrow down the focus to the symbology and the cosmology of the Yi. Does anyone of you use it? Pocossin and Hilary have made references to using it in the past...Does anyone have an opinion? Thank you !P.S: This volume is the same that is featured in one of the episodes of the ""Poirot"" series, where Miss Lemon and Captain Hastings beguile themselves casting the I Ching while the Belgian sleuth is absent.Last edited: May 23, 2013"

169,"Please consider taking a look at my new book, I Ching Mathematics:  The Science of Change.  http://www.thetolteciching.com/blog/i-ching-mathematics/This is the culmination of my 45 years of research into the self-organizing principle underlying change among the hexagrams.  Ever since my two years of study with Master Khigh Alx Dhiegh, I have been inspired by his charge, To make the unchanging principles of the I more relevant to the historical era in which we live.This new book does not purport to have discovered how the ancients used binary mathematics to conduct divinations.  I know of no good justification for such a claim.  What is does do is show how our modern concept of binary mathematics allows us to open up the divinatory process to much fuller and deeper analysis and, therefore, more comprehensive interpretation.Specifically, it does this by recognizing that each of the hexagrams is a binary number falling within the range of 0 – 63.  Once we accept this premise then it becomes unavoidable to treat them as numbers and, therefore, open to mathematical calculations—particularly, operations of addition and subtraction.  The change, then, between the initial hexagram (and its line changes) into its derived hexagram is a mathematical  change—one that results in a binary number within the range of 0 – 63.  The movement from hexagram to hexagram, in other words, results in a binary number, which is by definition, a third hexagram.  This third, mediating, hexagram is utterly indispensible to understanding the relationship between the hexagrams received through the divination by coins, milfoil, or other means.From this initial insight, it is possible to construct an interpretive model comprising eight pairs of hexagrams, each of which derives mathematically from the divinatory hexagram and its line changes.  For the purpose of illustration, I’ve placed that interpretive protocol up on my site here:  http://www.thetolteciching.com/blog/nine-emanations-of-the-oracle/  .  This interpretive model benefits from as thorough an investigation of the unchanging lines as the changing lines.I am a diviner, not a scholar or academic.  This is a book for diviners, one by which their interpretations of the Oracle’s answers can be expanded into new dimensions.  This is particularly useful when analyzing complex questions that the Oracle’s answer fails to clarify in full.It should be noted that all the material in this book pertains to purely mathematical relationships between hexagrams, regardless of which version of the I Ching one uses.  I’m well aware that the folks on this forum use the King Wen version and may suffer some discomfort at my using examples from the Toltec I Ching version.  For diviners interested in pursuing an expanded interpretive model of their divinations, however, such differences are of no moment—there is a conversion chart at the end of the book for the King Wen sequence and I have posted transposition charts online here:  http://www.thetolteciching.com/blog/addendum-iii-i-ching-mathematics/.I wish each of you the greatest success in your work,William Douglas Horden"
170,"I am stoked.  Prowling around this site, I looked at some of the reading recommendations.  Hilary pointed out that the more translations of the I Ching one has, the better.  My experience with multiple translations of the Tao Te Ching persuades me of the wisdom of this advice.  I've been using the Huang and Wilhelm translations up to this point, but today I received my copies of the Ritsema and Karcher I Ching with concordance and Karcher's ""I Ching Plain and Simple.""  Stoked!  (That's Yank for ""excited,"" by the way.)  Thank you, Hilary, I have a lot of work to do and I'm grateful for it.

175,"Music from the Last SupperThe Music From The Last Supper""][Can't seem to post an image....]The following deals with the I Ching symbolism of Da Vinci's art. It is important to remember some key points:The Medici, especially Lorenzo had a large influence on Da Vinci.The Medici in the 1400's on seeing the University of Pisa was in effect bankrupt, stepped in financially and restructured the university, taking the Greek facility and re positioning it in Florence.Around the same time was the sacking of Constantinople which lead to the leading ancient Greek scholars of the day fleeing, some of which were then employed by Medici at what was then called the Florentine University.The leading Greek scholar, along with Marsillo Ficino and Lorenzo set up the Academy outside of Florence, on the basis of a Platonic School to discuss mainly philosophy. The Greek scholar John Argyroulos, now working at the Florentine University, had a particularly gifted student there, who he decided to bring along to the Academy, his name was Leonardo Da Vinci.The Medici were at that time one of the richest families in the world, and traded globally. Amongst other things they became the leading suppliers of silk to the Vatican, however their trade and intellectual links with China were to remain a very well kept secret.In the Chinese Classic The Mustard Seed Garden, the guidelines for Chinese art, and image combinations are dealt with at length. Great care is taken to explain how images should combine and correspond to the ancient Chinese classics, in particular The Book of Changes. Often wrongly discredited as mystical, the Book of Changes deals with probabilities related to cause and effect in the human condition, taking its basis originally form the compounds of elemental symbolism such as earth, air, fire, and water [metal also]. The construct is vast, beautiful and illuminating.His greatest work was the Mona Lisa [Mo - Nah - Li - Sah is a transliteration of Chinese words 莫 阿 利 薩 which means – There is no one who can sweet talk profits from God] I will deal with as a separate text.Thus the symbolism computes as follows, and refers back to ancient text, and would have been consistent with the instructions given to him on the commissioning of the work.Jesus Hand Face= Retreat keeps his distance from mean spirited persons.

He nourishes his character. Jesus dispenses resources downward and avoids dwelling upon his virtues. Jesus discriminates between superior and inferior, and thereby stablises public opinion. Jesus controls his indignation and is moderate in his desires. Jesus dispenses resources downward and avoids dwelling upon his virtues. Jesus will take personal risks to carry out a purpose. Jesus evolves systems of proper regulation and determines the finer points of proper conduct. Jesus worked steadily to exert will therefore, he nourishes his character.Jesus keeps his distance from mean spirited persons. Jesus avoids exhibiting anger and maintains his dignity. Benefiting from harmony between heaven and earth, Jesus is able to organise and interpret the will of God and, in doing so, helps othersJesus is reserved in behavior and in that way avoids misfortune.

Change Circle are resuming regular monthly calls, on the 4th Saturday of each month.We’ll talk about a variety of Yi-related things: anyone can bring a reading for discussion, or we may settle in as a ‘study group’ and focus on how to engage with different aspects of readings – trigrams, nuclears, line relationships and so on.If you’re a member of Change Circle, do visit the thread for the first call and post your reading or question or both.If you’re not, you are absolutely welcome to join. There’s the private Reading Circle forum (guaranteed unGoogled), access to the excellent WikiWing, and calls (the first of which would actually fall within your free trial period, come to think of it), and that warm glow of satisfaction that comes from helping to pay Clarity’s bills.

180,"This small, modest, privately published translation and commentary on the Zhouyi came to my attention through what amounts to a rave review on Steve Marshall's site. I'd actually seen the book in a local store several years ago and dismissed it as another amateur yijing translation despite the fact that the author (born Charles Belyea) had lived in China for many years and had been adopted into the family of a Chinese diviner whose history of yijing practice went back more than a hundred generations.I just wanted to say that my first query gave me an answer so close to my actual situation that I could hardly believe what I was seeing.  Liu MIng's commentaries on the hexagrams and lines are short (rarely more than a sentence) but get to the heart his understanding of the message.  LIke Clarity's I Ching it's the result of many years of reading for self and others and bears the mark of experience rather than received opinion.  (I checked  Liu Ming's reading against Hilary's and was surprised by how much they resembled each other.) I'd recommend that for more information you look for the review on Marshall's site.The book is $30 USD list, findable on US Amazon and hopefully elsewhere in Europe, and I can already see that it will be my primary version for study and use for some time.

I have a limited number of openings – just four this time.I limit myself to these small numbers because I ‘carry the reading with me’ for a month, reviewing and revisiting, listening for synchronicities, and chatting via email with the querent as the reading unfolds. I don’t have the capacity to do this for many people at once! And I also need to limit ‘opening times’ so I can give readings the focus and energy they need – and so I always look forward to the* experience   .The individual reading service I offer these days is a spacious, in-depth exploration, through three calls and however-many emails over the course of a month or so.

187,"Hi all, since a while I am looking for english books about Wen Wang Gua  文王卦 also known as Liu Yao Yi Gua 六爻易卦, Na Jia  and as Six Line method or method of Six Lines in english.  It is very hard to find something at all about it, because there is simply almost nothing written about it in english. Finaly I had some luck because, Harmen Mesker http://i-tjingcentrum.nl/wp/ gave me this great hint: The Secret of Wen Wang Gua by Jack Chiu: http://www.acmc.com.hk/Book011.aspxI have read this book and I can highly recommend it. I looked for a review here at the forum, but couldn`t find one and so I hope this information is actually new for you. I write down here the table of contents for you, so that you know what you can expect from this book, because that is a lot: Part 1: Wen-Wang Gua The Basics of YiFu-xi Ba-guaAcquired Ba-guaMetaphors of Ba-guaZhou YiThe Rectangular and Circular Diagram of the 64 HexagramsWhat is Wen-Wang Gua? Revealing Yi – JingPart 2: CastingNotations of ChangesCasting MethodEvolution in CastingQian-Long Tong-BaoPart 3: SettingStems and Branches Recording SystemWu-xing Properties of the 64 HexagramsAdoption of Heavenly Stems and Earthly BranchesThe Six RelativesVisible and Invisible TheoryThe Active Line and the Changed LineSix Celestial FiguresPart 4 Deciphering: Effects of the Day of CastingEffects of the Active LinesThe Twelve Cyclic Stages of Wu–xingOther ConsiderationsPart 5: Wen-Wang Gua in Real LifeExample 1: Weather ForecastExample 2: Medical School ApplicationExample 3: Accident ClaimsExample 4: Divorce and Child CustodyExample 5: Health and DiseaseExample 6: La Liga 20007/2008 – Real Madrid Vs. Real ZaragozaExample 7: China Outlook in 2009Example 8: Stock Market ForecastThe book was published in March 2010 and it is exactly the book I was waited for  The Author did a very good job here because he wasn`t too lazy to write it all in pinyin, in chinese and in english. So this is probably the book all Wen-Wang Gua interested people have been waited for. Jack Chiu explains all parts of Wen Wang Gua:- 12 Earthly Branches (shi-er di-zhi 十二地支)- 10 Heavenly Stems (shi tian-gan 十天干)- 5 Elements (wu-xing 五行)- 6 Characters (Jack Chiu calls them 6 Relatives or liu qin 六親. Six because if yourself is included they are 6. Special hint: For all of you who are trying to learn Wen-Wang Gua according to Alex Chiu`s teaching method: http://superiching.com/index.html  Alex Chiu is calling them the 5 Stars. I guess just for making the confusion complete after the use of his abbreviations for the 12 earthly branches already drove you completely mad ;-))- 6 Celestial figures (also known as 6 heavenly creatures or six animals or liu shou 六獸)- The 8 Chambers (also known as 8 Palaces, 8 Houses or Eight Chambers Theory or ba-gong gua shuo 八宮卦說)- The Trigrams- The HexagramsOf course he also explains how to adapt it all to the lines and the hexagrams and he explains all the relationships and effects of all forces among each other and so it is actually a book which teaches Wen Wang Gua entirely, because everybody can learn it by reading this book. It is complete. Nothing is missing and the only thing one have to do is to learn, to understand and to practise. Also the rules are explained in a way everybody is able to understand easily!!! Apart from that he also gives us a lot of informations about the Yijing 周易 in general, he explains all very detailed and even the ones of you who are dealing with the Yijing since a longer time will probably get some new and/or additional informations from this book. He also reports about historical persons who were connected with the Yijing and Wen-Wang Gua and you get a lot of detailed historical information concerning the Yijing in addition. One thing which made me insanely happy was the use of pinyin, chinese and english. He gives us the possibility to do own internet researches by writing most accurately all important terms in pinyin, chinese and english same time.For making it perfect he gives us a lot of graphics, tables and drawings for to help us understanding all as easy as possible and for having great overviews when it comes to the part of six line analysis. The only thing which could be more are the examples of the practical use of WWG, because more of them would bring a lot more insights for beginners. But maybe this is a great idea for a second book about Wen-Wang Gua  If Mr. Jack Chiu will maybe read this here: Many, many, many thanks for writing this book and if I may have a wish, I wish a second book with a lot of practical examples as the next one   Many thanks to Jack Chiu for writing this amazing and very helpful book and special thanks to Harmen Mesker for giving me a lot of helpful informations about Wen-Wang Gua and for helping Mr. Chiu with his book (I have read Harmen helped Jack Chiu with his feedback to the draft of the book). Jack Chiu also mentioned his apprentice Anna Young as his helping hand at the writing process and so I also wish to thank Anna Young as I thank simply everybody who helped to make this book become reality. Just for to say something critical in the end (because this is a book review;-)): It is to see that Jack Chiu had to hurry up finishing his work because he hadn`t much time for it and so there are a couple of typing errors but I really, really don`t mind, lol. I`m so glad about the existence of this book that I even would pardon him if he would had forget to number the pages. Enjoy  Last edited: Jan 15, 2013"

This I Ching Readings Journal is an elegant, useful thing with a superb search function that makes it easy to find a half-remembered reading, or uncover patterns among many readings. It has a bunch of features that would be quite meaningless to anyone not Yi-fixated - from 'store your own notes on a per-line basis' to 'copy in your own translations' to 'click this tab to see past readings that included this line' to 'search by change pattern' to 'find all readings about topic x with the trigram kan'.All included by request of one user or another.This is all available now for £15, which is bordering on the silly. Also, when the new software's ready, we'll send purchasers of this one a voucher for £15 off, making this one sort-of free. You'll be able to import readings from the old software to the new.Provisos and small print... the I Ching Readings Journal is Windows-only, not Mac (new software will be for Macs too), and we don't know if it works on Windows 8. (Try the free trial before purchase!) There'll be basic support and fixes for any bugs, but no more major upgrades, as Justin's concentrating his efforts on the shiny new software.

193,"Stuart Alve Olson is the author of, among other books, Tai chi according to the I Ching"" a highly recommended book if not for tai chi die-hards for I Ching aficionados. There is a wealth of interesting material regarding the after heaven and before heaven arrangements of the trigrams and how, when combined with their complementary images and the arrangement of the eight gates or eight winds as described in the book of odes, they provide the basis for the creation of two tai chi forms which look very similar to the Yang long style with a few alterations. This paper feeds on some of these ideas , namely the after heaven images, to elaborate on a possible explanation to the ordering of the hexagrams as we know it today. http://www.valleyspiritarts.com/resources/Yi_Jing_Article.pdfSergioLast edited: Aug 14, 2013"

202,"Hi all, I promised you a new Wen Wang Gua book review a while ago. Here it is  I wish to introduce you The Clear-Cut I Ching For Beginners by Master S.R.Chang. http://www.cciching.com/At Amazon.comIt is actually another Wen Wang Gua book and I discovered it while I was looking exactly for this, for books about Wen Wang Gua. First I was a little bit disappointed, because I expected, or better said hoped that it would be another book which is teaching Wen Wang Gua. This is not the case here. But then I started to read it and to work with it and recognized that I discovered another treasure although it doesn`t teach Wen Wang Gua. It is a prepared text of the 64 Hexagrams and so it works similar to the use of the Text I Ching as we all know it, but the text is different. The advice you get is short and clear and there is no interpretation needed, because the answers are more than easy to understand. Not only the text is different, the casting methods are also different and I find this very intresting. Master S.R. Chang offers 4 methods of Casting: 1. The Coin Toss Method:This is similar to the casting method of the text I Ching. You throw your coins six times and write down the lines of the Hexagram (according the instructions by Master S.R.Chang) but there are no changing lines. The Hexagram is always unchanged. 2. The Playing Card Method:I left this one for you to try by yourself  3. The Tarot Card Method:Well this one is just great. You choose six Tarot Cards instead of tossing the three coins and so you get a lot of additional information about the situation, by the Tarot Cards. This is the most complex casting method Master S. R.Chang offers, because here you get the most information. I like it a lot, but I just use it if I actually need more detailed information. Apart from that I like the Coin Toss Method most. 4. The Numbers Remainder Method:This is intresting and it works. For this casting method you need nothing else than yourself. No coins, no cards just your mind. You concentrate on your question, and when you are ready then you release the question and when your mind is temporarily blank, allow a two-digit number to emerge from your mind. According a certain method explained at the book you find out your oracle then. I also tried this and felt a bit strange by doing this, but it seems to work as well as all the other casting methods. If you have casted your Hexagram you can look it up at the book and get your oracle. It works similar to the use of the normal text I Ching. There are the 64.Hexagrams, but the text is different to the I Ching how we all know it. Master S.R.Chang wrote an introduction for each hexagram and its general meaning and then some categories are following for the outcome in general, job and career issues, legal matters, health issues, projects, conflicts, love and relationsship questions and so on. Please check out Master S.R. Chang`s blog because there are all examples of the content. The answer is to get quick and easy, it is short and clear. The Clear Cut I Ching. This is for all the beginners in I Ching at all. All of you who have got problems to understand and interprete the regulary text of the I Ching will find very easy, a clear and simple answer here. For all of you who are consider about the main meaning of the pure unchanged Hexagram this is a great lesson too because exactly this is the message here. There is no compromise, no doubt, no changing lines or complicated analysis, no puzzles at this Clear Cut I Ching. You ask and you get a clear answer and you don`t need to ask Yi a hundred times in addition for to understand the meaning because each child would understand the answer immediately and easily. For advanced ones this is also great because it is just a great relief to get this pretty clear oracles no matter if they are auspicious or inauspicious. It`s just great to get this clear answer at all. The Clear Cut I Ching found its permanent place among all my other I Ching books and I consult it as often as I do this with other methods, because I also like the effectivity of  simplicity a lot. The Text of the Clear Cut I Ching and what it has to do with Wen Wang Gua is explained at the book:Master S.R.Chang literally: „The Chinese characters above are a partial representation of the symbols used in the full Clear Cut- method of the I Ching analysis. For the readers of this book, you should not be concerned with those symbols and characters at all. I have included them here out of my deepest respect for the Clear-Cut Method and its long-lineage of practitioners. Indeed the Clear-Cut Method is vastly deeper and richer than the version presented here. Neverthless, the ancient and the closely guarded book of Duan-Yi-Tian-Ji 斷易天機 or DYTJ inspired this first-ever English version of the Clear-Cut Method. The book DYTJ is believed to have been written in the Wan-Li Period of the Ming Dynasty, between 1573 CE to 1620 CE, or about some 400 years ago. Although the aforementioned book was written 400 years ago; but it was a continual expansion on a divination system that traces its origins to over 2,000 years ago. What makes this particular book, DYTJ, extraordinary was that in addition to the deep and complex discourses on the traditional Clear-Cut Method of the I Ching, the author wrote direct and clear answers to between sixteen to nineteen question categories of everyday life situations for each of the sixty-four hexagrams. Therefore, even the readers of the original DYTJ book were able to get clear and direct answers to their questions without having to go through the rigorous training process of the entire Clear-Cut Method. Since the book was written more than 400 years ago, many of the original questions categories and the answers given no longer fit the modern world. Inspired by the original intent of the book, I have thus re-calculated, expanded, modified, and updated the materials to fit the modern world. „ Quote end. One special highlight for me was the introduction of the book „The origins of the Clear-Cut Method“, because Master S.R.Chang told us the whole story of Jing Fang`s live and destiny and he also talked about the Master of Jing Fang which is called Jiao Yan Shou and that was really first time I have read the whole story. Many thanks for this to Master S.R. Chang  You can also read this on his blog:http://www.cciching.com/the-clear-cut-method/This Clear Cut I Ching is a completely new kind of I Ching book and it could also be called Wen Wang Gua light version, because you don`t need to learn Wen Wang Gua for to use this Clear Cut I Ching for beginners. Everybody can use it and understand it easily. It is great for beginners and advanced and it is just the beginning. I`m full of expectations concerning the next books by Master S.R. Chang and hope to help you with my new discovery the Clear-Cut I Ching. Just try it and you will also discover the effectivity of simplicity and you also will find the clear answers you had been looking for. For all Wen Wang Gua practitioners: The adoption of the 12 Earthly Branches, The Wu-Xing properties, The 5 Relatives, Subject and Object Line is already done at all the 64. Hexagrams. So this book can also be used as a reference book for the setting at all hexagrams. Master S.R.Chang used the chinese Characters here only, but all Wen Wang Gua practitioners should anyway learn the chinese Characters too for to understand additional literature about the theme much better and because in respect for the traditions. I will give you here the translation for all Chinese Characters Master S.R.Chang used at the Hexagrams.

204,"I hope this  shameless plug is acceptable for posting.After years of prototyping and modifications, the first generation of Yi Dao circlets are now available for sale at my Etsy store:http://www.etsy.com/shop/AmaranthBeadsThe Yi Dao circlet is a set of meditation beads inspired by the mala of Buddhist and Hindu cultures and the prayer beads and worry beads of other cultures. It has a 'tower' representing Tai Qi, Si Xiang and Ba Gua, and 64 beads, one for each hexagram. The document that accompanies the beads and discusses Yi Dao (the Path of the Yi Jing, or Easy Path), and the use of the beads in meditation is too large to attach here, so please email me directly if you would like a copy.Please note, there are several kinds of circlets available. All of the ones currently on sale have identical or matching stones at the end of each row. I am placing some of the new circlets in the store soon. This new design of circlet has seven different stones at the row ends (with the eight row end a normal sized stone). I can also create custom circlets using your own beads as long as they are within a certain range of sizes and of a material that stands up under use.Regards,Chris Gait"
205,"Hi,I have a question about the hexagram lookup table that appears in the Richard Wilhelm translation of the I Ching. The Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching) hexagram lookup table uses the same sequence as Wilhelm, but the Wilhelm translation makes no mention of why the arrangement was chosen. The upper and lower trigrams do not follow either the Fu Xi (Qian, Xun, Kan, Gen, Kun, Zhen, Li, Dui) or King Wen (Li, Kun, Dui, Qian, Kan, Gen, Zhen, Xun) trigram sequences, and instead are Qian, Zhen, Kan, Gen, Kun, Xun, Li, Dui, which is similar to Fu Xi except that Xun and Zhen are switched. Does anyone know why this sequence of trigrams was chosen for the lookup table, and whether it is unique to the Richard Wilhelm translation? Is it useful?Thanks,Brian"
206,"Is anyone familiar with RGH Siu's The Portable Dragon? I get the sense that hes' trying to get across the general description and feeling of each hexagram, but as far as I can tell (maybe I'm overlooking something very obvious) he's not discussing the lines at all."
207,"More on that ‘Radical Change at the Well’ reading soon, I promise. But first… Please will you do me a big favour and take this survey? Some background… I store a list of my readings on the computer. It’s tremendously helpful – it means that when I think, ‘Oh, hexagram 19, didn’t I get that a couple of months ago…?’ or even, ‘Wait, haven’t I already asked something like this?’ I can run a quick search and find the answer. It makes it that much easier for me to get the message and keep it in mind – carry it with me so that it makes a difference. Which, after all, is the point. Only then there are dreams, and sometimes I might pick a rune out of a bag or pick a book off the shelf at random, and what about the weirdly synchronistic thing I heard when I turned on the radio last night, and the meetings of goldfinches outside my window? I do my best to write these down, too, and keep track, and not lose sight of the overall themes and messages. But wouldn’t it be brilliant to have one place for it all – not just to write it down, but to find half-remembered things and see at a glance the unifying themes that I’d somehow missed? Well… I thought so… and to my complete delight, Justin Farrell (author of a excellent Yijing journal program) is prepared to create the software to do it: a journal software where you store all these things, and can review them via search or tag cloud. He just needs to know whether anyone else would buy it. So actually I have two requests. First, please take the survey! And second, do you know people who are not so Yijing-oriented, who wouldn’t be reading this blog, but who might be interested in software for some combination of dreams, synchronicities, tarot, runes and astrology? If so, could you forward them the link? Here it is to copy and paste – http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/journalsurvey.phpThank you! (By the way… there is a prize draw as a ‘thank you’ for doing the survey – nothing huge, but a free copy of the finished software, and a £20 Amazon gift voucher.)"

215,"Tomorrow is the Mayan beginning of the 5126 year cycle, the 14th B'ak'tun, unless the alternative counting method gives us Sunday instead. This change is probably more significant than is reckoned by the skeptics, but in any event it is the first day of the winter of 2013. For those of you who follow the 6 phase annual gua method that I have articulated elsewhere, this is the first day of the new gua that will unfold throughout 2013.If you have determined the gua, tomorrow the first line will become active and remain active until February 18th of 2013, when fate will transition to the second line. This is a reminder to contemplate that first line, absorb its iconography, take to heart its advice, and prepare. Let the image guide your behavior, the judgment guide your prognostication, and the line drive your insights and actions.Regardless of what the significance of the Mayan rollover of the long count, the I Ching will function, because it is part of nature, human nature, and human civilization. Even if one accepts the idea of cataclysm, one's role in it would be clearly defined by the I. If the cataclysm does not materialize, it changes nothing as far as using the book to apprehend, accept, and follow the Tao."

It began on August 21 and will end on October 21st. Example - year of peace - 11. Peace is about the mixture of the high and the low. Such mixture is advantageous.  During this fifth line, phase, I needed to move some furniture.  I was introduced to a sterling elder Mexican American gentleman who loaned me out of the goodness of his heart his truck at no cost.  What a great old 1989 Silverado truck with over 200,000 miles on it.This simple man loaned me his truck while he was at church on two Sundays, where he was a leader in his community. The second Sunday his brakes failed and he and I rebuilt the left rear brake assembly, which was it tuns out of great help to him.  All went well - the mixture of high and low, and the move was indeed very successful.This is what I enjoy, watching the lines coming true, month after month, year after year.Best To allLe Cubiste:bows:"

239,"Hi,I have updated the Yi Jing - Book of Changes app for the iPad. Here is a partial screen shot:The app has 3 key characteristics: * a question oracle* an integrated journal* multiple book translationsIn addition to supporting manual hexagram entry, a 3-coin oracle, and ""quick"" (one-tap), we've added a 4-coin oracle and a yarrow stalk oracle. The yarrow stalk oracle shows you how to perform the actual yarrow stalk divination—it's not just a click-once thing.The integrated journal supports editing questions with notes, sorting by topic, hexagram or date, a search feature, and access to a growing number of book translations. The journal separates out the present, changing lines and future (or context) hexagram readings. In addition, you can access the four component trigrams, and related hexagrams (opposite, inverse, reverse, and mutual/nuclear). In addition to a handful of translations included with the app (including Richter's pinyin/gloss and Carol K. Anthony's ""A Guide to the I Ching""), we now have in-app purchase options, ""I Ching Workbook"" by R.L. Wing, and ""The I Ching or Book of Changes"" by Richard Wilhelm and Cary F. Baynes (US and Canada only, a publishing restriction), and the complete ""I Ging das Buch der Wandlungen"" by Richard Wilhelm in German. It's really easy to switch between translations while viewing the journal.The app is also localized in 8 languages: English, German, Dutch, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese and of course, Chinese (both traditional and modern).More info can be found on my web site here:http://www.flatearthstudio.com/Apps/Apps.htmlI'm working on adding some new book translations, which are coming soon.Let me know what you think of it, and if there's anything I should add or improve.- Brian"

263,This - http://www.pushingupward.com/ - is apparently going to be 'a novel and film about the I Ching'. Sounds intriguing...
264,"I Ching Prescriptions are a different way of consulting the I Ching. The  traditional method for using the counsel of I Ching is by throwing  three coins six times or by dividing and counting yarrow stalks to  arrive at a hexagram for an answer to a question. This method of  allowing chance to provide an appropriate response to what is on your  mind at the time relies on a phenomenon that Carl Jung called  synchronicity.    Many people wonder how could anyone take seriously an  answer to a question arrived at by tossing coins and decide that the I  Ching is not for them. It doesn’t matter whether you believe in  synchronicity or not. It doesn’t matter if you want to take the time to  figure out the obscurity or understand the poetic symbolic language of  the I Ching. When people dismiss the I Ching because of the method of  relying on random chance they miss out on the philosophy that is  imbedded within the I Ching that originated over five thousands years of  Chinese culture. A philosophy that has survived for thousands of years  has a message worth pondering. Since the philosophy of I Ching is based  on nature and has lasted so many thousands of years and transferred over  many cultures, why not benefit from its wisdom whether you believe in  synchronicity or not? Find an I Ching Prescription for your need of the  moment.      "

268,"My dear friend, Ezequiel Saad, has published a new Yijing book in France and Spain. The books is bilingual (French/Spanish).Parution de « Deviner l’Inconscient » E. Saad Tobis, Deviner l’Inconscient, édition bilingue français – castillan, castellano – francés, Glose préliminaire: J. Zentner ; Postface: P. S. Naud. Paris - Barcelone 2009, Editions Punto ; 148 pages, illustré. Présentation Il existe un lien temporel entre les anciens Grecs et Chinois, mais on constate éga- lement un parallélisme d'intentions. En cette période du Ve siècle a. C., en Occident comme en Orient, une volonté de se distancier des origines divinatoires et magiques s’affirme pour faire place à la philosophie naissante, préambule à toute la connaissance psychologique ultérieure. Nous observons néanmoins que cette intuition divinatoire, utilisée avant que la philosophie n’existe, continue à imprégner les techniques psychologiques, et en particulier, psychanalytiques. En fait, mise à part la dose de philosophie nécessaire à l’intelligibilité des cas, le recours aux ressources de la perspicacité et de la déduction est toujours essentiel pour appréhender l’humain dans sa complexité.  Le nouveau livre d’E. Saad Tobis « Deviner l’Inconscient » résume la manière dont la sagesse chinoise parée du « Yi Jing », le Livre des Changements, et compénétrée des mathématiques, de la linguistique et de l'éthique prônée par Confucius, fait face à l'oracle de Delphes et au positionnement d'un Socrate. Ce livre retrace la manière dont ces piliers de la culture sont convoqués - directement ou indirectement - dans l'auscultation de l’Inconscient à des fins thérapeutiques. Il rapproche des connaissances qui semblent évidentes, mais dont les liens sont pourtant insuffisamment expliqués. Ce cheminement aboutit à un aspect de la destinée de l'analyse en Occident, qui pourrait bien devenir une forme d’arbitrage pour faire évoluer la sagesse héritée jusqu'à présent de la tradition - toutes origines confondues. Dans sa modernité, l'art de deviner consiste principalement à organiser stratégiquement l'information, avant qu'elle devienne la substance de l'interprétation et du diagnostic au sein de la cure. E. Saad Tobis Commandes disponibles dès maintenant par Internet à :   Consultpoint@aol.com  Prix 12  € + frais de port (en version papier).  E-Book (digital) : Prix 9  €« Adivinar el Inconsciente »  E.

Naud, Barcelona – Paris 2009, Ediciones Punto, 148 paginas, ilustrado.Presentación del libro Hay un vínculo temporal entre los antiguos griegos y los antiguos chinos, y también (en los alrededores del siglo V a. C) un paralelismo de intenciones: haber decretado la separación de los orígenes adivinatorios y mágicos para dar lugar a la filosofía naciente, preámbulo a todo el conocimiento psicológico posterior. Desde entonces, se puede constatar que –aparte de la dosis de filosofía necesaria para la comprensión de los casos– la perspicacia y la deducción que aún son empleadas en las técnicas psicológicas, y en particular psicoanalíticas, se impregnan de esta intuición adivinatoria que se utilizó antes de que la filosofía existiera. El nuevo libro “Adivinar el Inconsciente” de E. Saad, resume cómo la sabiduría china – equipada con el “I Ching“, el Libro de los Cambios, y compenetrada de matemáticas, de lingüística y de la ética predicada por Confucius– hace frente al oráculo de Delfos y a la posición intelectual de un Socrates. Y también cómo los dos se convocan –directa o indirectamente– en la auscultación del Inconsciente con finalidades terapeúticas. Esto es algo que, por ser demasiado evidente, no se dice ni se explica suficientemente. Tampoco se dice que, en occidente, el análisis está destinado a convertirse en una forma de arbitraje, y que posee la disposición más adecuada para hacer evolucionar la sabiduría que ha sido heredada hasta ahora de la tradición, sin distinción de orígenes. Principalmente, cuenta con el arte de conjeturar moderno, que consiste en organizar estratégicamente la información antes de que sea material para la interpretación, el diagnóstico o la cura.​"

279,"Dear all,As many of you know, Chris Lofting is not one to remain silent for long periods of time, not only here but also in his several mailing lists. The man can write extensively and with very focused purpose. For a beginner, and many seasoned students as well, to say that Chris is difficult to follow and comprehend, is an understatement. It certainly is. However, Chris should be properly credited with bringing a fresh perspective to the studies of the YIjing, a perspective that takes us away from ethereal convictions and places us in a developed system based on neurological and emotional studies. Alas, Chris have never spared words in his efforts to communicate, clarify and defend his theories. He wrote with abandon about them. This is why, silence, coming from someone like him, can be deafening. Several weeks ago, I sent him a few email messages, in different places, checking on him and his whereabouts. A few days ago I received a reply from his daughter, Kate Lofting, with some sad and concerning news about his health. I asked for Chris permission to share this with those whom have known him for years and would appreciate hearing from a fellow student that has expanded and contributed so much original material to the field of Yixue. Today, through Kate's kindness, I received his go ahead. Here is Kate's original message of Jul/09/2010:Hi Luis,My father, Chris Lofting, has been diagnosed with lung cancer and secondary bone cancer. He has a prognosis of about 6-9 months.I'm with him now in the hospice and thought you should know.Dad says he will miss you guys.Any updates to follow.Regards,Kate Lofting ​In my opinion, Chris has deservedly won a special place in Yixue, and also in the other fields he touched in his theories. I wish Chris all the best in his present battle."

284,"Step 1 – have an I Ching website.Step 2 – have a nice publisher contact you via said website and ask you to write a book.Then…Think of all the reasons why you absolutely should not do anything of the kind for another 10, 20 or 30 years. (This takes some time.) Think about them all some more. Check with the publisher in the faint hope they might want something you’d object to writing anyway, and find they do in fact want a real translation, with words from the real book. Check with Yi, and get encouragement.Gulp.Realise that one reason to write a book now is so you can write a better one later.Then…Well, I started with the text I wrote for the WikiWing, since that summed up my ideas for each line and included my ‘working translation’ (which turned out to need a whole lot of reworking). Then I gathered together everything from a vast Word doc that contains all my ever-expanding notes on each hexagram and line, that rejoices in the original name of MYNOTES.doc. (It was created before you could have long file names in Windows.) I made sure I had the line pathway – the journey through fan yao, paired line of fan yao, paired line of original line – copied into each line as well as its zhi gua.Then I added an ‘examples’ heading under each line and started gathering up example readings. Thank goodness I’ve been keeping my personal journal in a searchable format for some years now. (Another good reason to keep a searchable journal – you never know when someone might expect you to write a book.) Then I creatively cursed the inadequacies of Windows search, and installed Google desktop to search through ten years’ worth of clients’ readings. Finally, for lines where I was short of readings (I’d decided for some reason I wanted at least half a dozen different examples for each line), I visited the I Ching Community archives. *(I would’ve been utterly lost without the hexagram search that*Ewald created for us.)I also spent some time searching for ‘threads started by’ the querents in these readings to find out how things turned out, and developed a new and profound appreciation for the people who are kind enough to post updates on the same thread!I discovered the merits of coffee when working 12 hour days.Reading through all the ramblings of ‘MYNOTES’ on each line and its pathways, I distilled these into a series of questions: how important is it to do this? do people feel that? why isn’t it a mistake, and why might you think it was? what does this kind of constancy look like, what kind of danger is there, how does the zhi gua show up…? – and so on. Then with my gathered example readings, I set out to find which of my ideas about the line actually fit, and which was just a nice idea in theory, and where I really needed to start over and work things out without preconceived notions. The aim, after all, was to write a commentary that would pretty reliably help people with readings – so it made sense to start by writing one that would*have helped with the readings I know.I renegotiated the deadline with the (very) nice publishers.The next step was to distill all this down to a couple of paragraphs, agonising horribly over the choice of each word, trying to make them work with the explicit and implicit imagery of the text. Of course I want to be as specific and clear as possible, but not so specific that I exclude valid possibilities and get in the way of Yi talking to people. (Did I mention ‘gulp’?)Somewhere along the way, I (re)discovered the difference between interpreting a reading and interpreting a line of text. It’s quite daunting.As each hexagram was ‘finished’, in a provisional sort of way, I passed it to my husband to proof-read – which he did, and also pointed out all the unexplained assertions, logical discrepancies and unnecessary elaborations. I reminded myself repeatedly how generous he was being with his time (he really was!) and thought it all out again.I uploaded each hexagram to the Change Circle’s private ‘jewelbox’ of downloads, where people looked at them and said kind and helpful things, and got me rewriting 29.6 in particular. Then, wonderfully, Bradford Hatcher volunteered to look through the work. He was*indescribably helpful, and blessedly unintimidating for someone who’s forgotten more about this book than I’m ever likely to know. (I was already leaning heavily on his work for the ‘translation’ part, as well as LiSe, Harmen, Wilhelm, Lynn, Marshall, Rutt and God-bless-the-clickable-Wenlin for comparing word usage in Yijing and Shijing.)Send finished work to nice publisher, who tells me it’s too long. Shorten it. Embarrassing how possible this is.Still too long. Negotiate via nice, patient lady at publishers with design department to move the illustrations around as an alternative to cutting more words. Still need to cut some more or it won’t fit on the page – OK, getting good at this…Finished!Go outdoors in daylight, and try to remember what they call that big, blue ceiling thing.Start a file called ‘corrections.doc’.Wait for the book to be published.And here it is. (US, UK and Canada)Erm… let me know what you think?"

287,"Jennifer Louden’s an opening speaker – and a speaker about ‘opening’ – for the Festival of Change. I asked her to participate after I discovered her ‘listening to the question’ audio. As you might imagine, the title caught my attention – I spend a whole lot of time listening to questions, other people’s as well as my own. So I travelled through Jen’s audio retreat with her, listened, opened… enjoyed it but felt grumpily that nothing much had happened… and then over the next couple of days experienced some of the most revealing synchronicities I’ve ever encountered. Hmm.So this experience, plus enjoying what she writes, plus the fact that her wonderful Virtual Retreats were what first gave me the idea of running an event that would be a whole, coherent experience rather than just a string of information… all meant that asking her seemed like a Very Good Idea.Then naturally I talked with Yi (as I did with all the speakers), asking what it would mean to partner with her on this. Yi said 14.2.4 changing to 22: Great Possession’s Beauty. I think this refers amongst other things to the fact that she’s the most well-known among the speakers. It also shows the richness of what she offers, how she can provide a big enough ‘vehicle’ to carry us through, and how it would be best if I didn’t try to impose my ideas on her too much!Timezones permitting, Jen’s call will be the first of the event, on 4th September. We’ll be talking – as you might have guessed – about questions: why they’re important, what knots we tie ourselves in with them and how we might untie a few. And Jen will take us through a guided meditation for listening to questions. (Something similar to the one that led to such amazing experiences for me.)We’ll take questions during the call, as many as we have time for – but what would you say I should definitely ask her?"

289,"I’ve been working hard on this behind the scenes for a while now, and it’s high time I let you know about it…When – 4th to 12th SeptemberWhere – wherever you happen to be, within reach of a phone line – we’ll connect via teleseminars and a private forum.What - a Festival of Change.This is to celebrate change, and explore ways we align ourselves with its flow – through oracles of all kinds, dreams, paying attention to synchronicities… everything we use to be more in touch with the inner nature of the moment. It’s about that state of connection that gives you full-colour, full-dimensional, full-resonance living – real freedom of movement, because you’re actually living in the whole real, changing world.The intention is to have an event that will both enrich and deepen existing divination practice and also make that experience of connection and*fluency available to people who have never tried divination before.So… if you know someone you wish you could share divination with, this will be a good way to introduce them. (If I can see a way to make it work technically, ‘bring a friend for free’ will be included in the ticket price.) The Festival of Change isn’t just going to be a catalogue of ideas – there’s a simple structure to it, designed to support the actual experience of connecting with the currents of change, making it accessible without necessarily knowing an oracle. (And recordings of each call will be included, to make this a resource you can draw on in future.)The structure… two weekends of teleseminar interviews with a whole variety of speakers, framing a week of discussion on a private forum.4th September – Opening the channel: how we create the space to listen and receive the answer.5th September – Connecting with the response, recognising it, hearing it as something that speaks to you personally.Then a week to try out what these first speakers have offered, ask questions and share experiences at the forum, and then…11th September – Integrating the answer into real life, allowing it to become real change in practice.12th Sept – I’m hoping to have a final Q&A call with as many of the speakers as possible, drawing the threads together and answering people’s questions. (I think this is the call I’m most looking forward to – with lots of  different perspectives meeting, I expect creative sparks will fly.)So you see how this follows through the basic contours of a reading (or experience with synchronicity, or working with a dream…) and fits with the real experience – during the Festival itself, or any time you use the recordings.I’ll follow up with more information later about the different themes, introducing you to the speakers and getting your questions to ask them. Meanwhile… well, this is the first time I’ve done anything like this, and I’m going to be running in circles finalising things with speakers and putting things together. I’d really welcome any comments or suggestions."

293,"I invite you to try a new and free I Ching programme, the ""Yijing"". It has been twelve years in the making. It offers basic I Ching usage and permits comparative I Ching research. Its interface runs in English, French, German and Spanish. The included texts are the copy-expired versions by Legge, 1899 and Wilhem, 1924 (German). You can also attach your own I Ching files to the program, either by chapters or in book form.The basic user can simply click the ""Consult"" button, and rapidly obtain a hexagram and the accompanying text. The moving-line texts are displayed separately in a split screen for rapid reading. Attached reference texts in chapter form open according to the hexagram that was cast.Advanced users can record questions and answers in an ongoing database. Also, various aspects of the question, such as context and outcome, can be annotated. Furthermore, multiple I Ching ""consultation projects"" can be maintained, for following different life issues. The database is maintained as text files, for easy further analysis with external programmes (Excel, or user-created programmes).For the researcher, the Chinese-English Legge translation is included.Alfred Huang's etymologically motivated English translations of the 64 hexagram titles were incorporated into the Yijing programme and were translated into French, German and Spanish. They serve as a comparative guide to Wilhelm's and others' title translations. Furthermore, the Chinese titles are transliterated into intonation-marked Pinyin, and MP3 pronunciations of the hexagram titles are available in the programme.The programme is freeware. Download the programme from www.melkiades.com. Look for the ""Yijing"" tab.The programme runs as a Java jar-file on Windows, Ubuntu Linux and Macintosh.Melki"

298,"I didn't really know where to post this............Over in Exploring Divination Hilary’s blog on Nearing, Seeing pressed a few memory buttons that reminded me of a couple of things in India.  Lin: Nearing reminded me of the Sanskritic idea of Darsan which is about more than just being a devotee in the presence of a deity and looking; and is actually about an exchange that takes place between the eyes.  As I said in my post, the deity gives darsan and the devotee receives it.  I observed that this is often represented in Street Art as dotted lines between the eyes of the two.  In my mind there is a relation of “overseeing” by the deity.  Hilary pointed out that Lise says something similar about the eyes in ancient Chinese inscriptions of Lin: “Another old form of Lin shows connecting lines between the eye and the objects (a).”  The India button had been duly pressed and for Kuan I remembered the pillars of Asoka.The pillars of Asoka are scattered around India, are/were around 50 feet high and along with various bits of Buddhist symbolism bear the edicts of Asoka in the popular (as opposed to “elite”) language of the day.  They suggest ideas such as the mutual existence and understanding of religions.  Some articles about the pillars don’t get past Asoka’s Buddhism and thus see them as religious but there is much more to them than that.Ven S Dhammika: “Scholars have suggested that because the edicts say nothing about the philosophical aspects of Buddhism, Asoka had a simplistic and naive understanding of the Dhamma. This view does not take into account the fact that the purpose of the edicts was not to expound the truths of Buddhism, but to inform the people of Asoka's reforms and to encourage them to be more generous, kind and moral. This being the case, there was no reason for Asoka to discuss Buddhist philosophy. Asoka emerges from his edicts as an able administrator, an intelligent human being and as a devoted Buddhist, and we could expect him to take as keen an interest in Buddhist philosophy as he did in Buddhist practice.”Click to expand...These pillars were constructed along borders, trade routes, densely populated areas, pilgrimage centres and Buddhist sites.  In other words wherever they would get the maximum audience or readership.  They were made of a sandstone that was so highly polished they shone as if made of metal.  In other words there was no way you could miss them.  To see and be seen…….  Kuan?Ven S Dhammika:“The contents of Asoka's edicts make it clear that all the legends about his wise and humane rule are more than justified and qualify him to be ranked as one of the greatest rulers. In his edicts, he spoke of what might be called state morality, and private or individual morality. The first was what he based his administration upon and what he hoped would lead to a more just, more spiritually inclined society, while the second was what he recommended and encouraged individuals to practice. Both these types of morality were imbued with the Buddhist values of compassion, moderation, tolerance and respect for all life.”Click to expand...Anyway, here is the link to Dhamikka’s article which goes into good detail as to what was written on the pillars for those who are interested:http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/ashoka.htmlI am not, by the way, trying to assert that these two things are “the same” as Lin and Kuan – just a remarkable connection in quite ancient thinking.   Meanwhile, in the same Exploring Divination thread, there was a gentle debate about “culture” and the movement of people’s in ancient times was raised.So, all this is a long winded way to introduce an interesting and readable essay by the multi-talented Indian economist Amartya Sen in which he talks about some of the exchanges between India and China.  Here is a tiny excerpt:Amartya Sen:“Certainly religion has been a major source of contact between China and India, and Buddhism was central to the movement of people and ideas between the two countries. But the wider influence of Buddhism was not confined to religion. Its secular impact stretched into science, mathematics, literature, linguistics, architecture, medicine, and music. We know from the elaborate accounts left by a number of Chinese visitors to India, such as Faxian in the fifth century and Xuanzang and Yi Jing in the seventh,[1] that their interest was by no means restricted to religious theory and practices.”Click to expand...Sen goes back in time to the start of Buddhism but there is no doubt that these exchanges were taking place well before then.  Anyone who has been to what now constitutes the borders of India, Pakistan and China and Tibet will have a feel for what I mean.   Here is a link to the essay and I hope you enjoy………………………..http://www.cul-studies.com/english/chinastudies/200412/351.htmlLucia"

304,"Stephen Karcher’s latest book, I Ching – the Symbolic Life –  is a self-published work. The advantage of this: he’s been able to create and illustrate the book he wanted, in colour, with no corners cut. The disadvantage: the price is a little scary. I ordered my copy from the US, which turned out to be cheaper than in the UK even after postage. It’s a colourful book with a clear, open layout that uses colour to reinforce the associations between hexagrams and trigrams. It also includes small illustrations for each hexagram, drawn from Stephen’s ‘Paper Horses’ work. (Aside: the book itself simply describes these as ‘an image that gives you a feeling tone,’ intended to deepen your intuitive sense of the hexagram. But for more background on them, thoughts on the workings of images, and characterisation of the trigrams, download the pdf from here. Whether you get the book or not, this is abundantly worth reading for its description of the inner and outer landscape where divination takes place.)What’s unique What’s new in I Ching – the Symbolic Life is the seamless blend of imagery from the text with imagery from the hexagrams’ structural relationships. There’s no translation set apart from the rest of the text; instead, there are excerpts and improvisations on the translation woven into the interpretation of the structures. The joy of discovering structural relationships within the Yijing is the way they can deepen and enrich readings, so you often find that all the answers you seek are already contained within a single answer; there’s no need to muddy the waters with a flurry of extra readings. It gives you a powerful sense of the way divination connects all areas of life and all layers of experience. And the snag of discovering these relationships is that it generates a huge volume of technical stuff to bear in mind, and a huge range of connected hexagrams. There’s the paired hexagram, the Sequence, the nuclear hexagram, the family of hexagrams that surround that nuclear hexagram, the complementary hexagram, the hexagram created by reversing the trigrams, the Early Heaven hexagram, the Shadow Site… that’s anything up to ten other hexagrams to consider – before you even change any lines. The message of the reading can get very, very lost in a blur of information overload. To access the richness of these connections without getting completely lost, you could absorb them all into your awareness of each hexagram – this may take quite a few years. You could also use this book. The connections show up here as they might do in a reading from a diviner who has all these things deeply integrated into his sense of the hexagram. Naturally, he’d let this awareness percolate through into his interpretation without overwhelming the person he was reading for by enumerating all his sources. And in the same way, in the book, some sources are explained and some aren’t. Similarly, the use of the translation reflects what a diviner might do in practice, maybe after reading out the words of the oracle. What you get here, instead of a complete word-for-word translation, is something like an improvisation on the text. It’s generally very close to it – the oracle of Hexagram 47, for instance, originally says, ‘Confined, creating success.Constancy of a great person, good fortune.Not a mistake.There are words, no trust.’ - and the first passage on Hexagram 47 begins,“You are cut off, oppressed and exhausted. Collect the energy to get out of this prison and re-establish communication. Be great and master the situation from within. Find what is truly important. Seek those who can help and advise you. The situation is not your fault but words are not to be trusted now. Do not believe what others are telling you to do…”​ So this talks about every part of the text, but also (as I suppose is inevitable with any commentary) pushes some possible meanings to the margins – for instance, that ‘words, no trust’ might indicate that the reasoning of your own inner voice is hollow and inauthentic. The text continues without break:“Let Confining be your inner guide. It will turn self containment into the ability to manage the flow and flux of events.”​ This is no longer drawn from the translation, but from the weaving of trigrams through the Pair. The intention must be that the reader will take and use all these ideas without worrying about where they came from. Also, she has a chance to absorb the relationships without consciously charting them, as both hexagrams and trigrams are consistently evoked using the same simple image-formula of words – a powerful way for ideas to put down roots and become familiar. This use of structure means that every word of the book has its source: the shortest of short phrases might have an essay’s-worth of theory – and no doubt countless hours of divination experience – behind it. Here’s a very short example, drawn from the trigram-based section of Hexagram 45; I’ve added the source for each part in square brackets:‘The Spirit HelpersLake above Earth [trigrams]. The Joyous Dancer and the Dark Animal Goddess [trigrams personified as spirit helpers – with the help of the Shuogua, I think]. This is Metal over Earth, an inner field that sustains outer stimulation [trigrams mapped to Five Elements]. Inner devotion now lets you express the spirit in the human community [trigram actions]. Take precautions and eliminate the causes of conflict [Daxiang text]. Do not accumulate great things for yourself [Complementary hexagram, 26, Great Taming/ Great Accumulating]. If you reaffirm common human needs and strengths [the Early Heaven hexagram, the ‘ideal’, Hexagram 48], the new spirit will reveal itself [the ‘Shadow Site’, Hexagram 20].’​ And for the background to just one of these concepts, see the article at GreatVessel on Ideal and Shadow, in the amusingly-named ‘I Ching Basics’ section. For each hexagram, there’s plenty of this kind of concentrated, distilled text that bears a lot of ‘unpacking’:A      heading summarising the hexagram’s advice, based on the Judgement      text and the movement between trigrams in the Pair Circle      of Meanings – thesaurus-like – with reference to the ancient Chinese name      of the hexagram Spirit      Helpers – trigrams (and complement, and Ideal and Shadow) Heart      Theme – the nuclear hexagram – and ‘Cycle of Seasons’ through the nuclear      hexagram family, which he suggests ‘shows how this process plays out      through time and the energies you can use to bring the action to      completion and find the seed of new growth.’ ‘Myths      for Change’ section, which begins by describing the Pair and then the Sequence text,       translated/elaborated as ‘Charge to the Inquirer’ and       a description of the hexagram (only subtly changed since Total I Ching) and       its position within the pair, decade, and probably some other       relationships I’ve yet to identify Hidden       Exchange – swapping the trigrams to show how one hexagram ‘enables’ and       develops another. Direct       interpretation and suggestions for action: immediate future, personal       development, working with others, working with organizations,       relationships.  Transforming      Lines. For each line (and I’m not altogether sure this is a comprehensive      list of what’s being used):Description       of that position in the hexagram (in terms of the complementary pair of       change patterns it creates – 24 and 44 for line 1, 7 and 13 for line 2,       etc Translation-elaboration-improvisation       on the text Instruction       based on the new trigram created by the line change. Advice       based on line pathway, travelling through paired line and fan yao. Advice       based on nuclear hexagram of relating hexagram and its nuclear hexagram.   So for instance for 45.1:‘Line 1 Beginnings: return of the spirit that brings the entrance of a new fate. You are connected to a deep source of energy but the connection with others is unclear. One moment you are joyous, the next moment confused. Call out! One grasp of the hand and all will laugh together. Rouse the new energy. Leave your current position and mingle with the people. Changes are coming. You can achieve something great. Serve the highest ideals. Do not pause in your efforts to eliminate inner sources of discord. Proceed step by step. Prepare a decisive new move.’​ Also, there’s an appendix at the back, ‘The Pairs in the Loom of Change’ describing how both trigrams and individual lines weave through each pair.Who’s the book for? I think it’s for fairly experienced users: people who already have a translation or twenty to hand and would like a way in to explore the meaning of the structures in the Yijing. (An interesting comparison would be with Nigel Richmond’s Language of the Lines.) I wouldn’t suggest this to a beginner as a sole source, because of the lack of clearly-differentiated translation – though it’d be interesting to read a review from a newcomer and see how this material ‘lands’ with someone who comes to it fresh. Maybe more importantly, it’s for users who are interested in diving deep into a reading. In the introduction, Karcher describes the I Ching as ‘1) a book; 2) a technique; and 3) a way or spiritual practice,’ and says,‘The long term use of this technique is the foundation of a spiritual practice or discipline that can give us a symbolic mirror that “reaches the depths, grasps the seeds and penetrates the wills of all beings Under Heaven.” In working with the symbols the Change offers, we experience how the Way or Dao is working in our lives. This Symbolic Mirror teaches us about the destiny that Heaven gave us (ming) when we entered this world and helps us manifest our innate power and virtue (de) in accord with that destiny. The practice transforms the shape of our heart-mind and links us with the Way of Water or Dao, the on-going process of the real. And, according to the ancient sages, this individual change of heart can synchronistically help to renew the world and the culture we live in.’​ From which you can probably tell that this is not your first port of call for predicting election outcomes or diagnosing computer problems. But I’ve found it very helpful already with a reading about the subtle forces shaping my relationship with a group, and one about incipient depression. Though this is clearly meant as a way into the depths, it’s meant as a simple way in. For instance, the only method of consulting suggested is one that always generates a single moving line (never more or less). This is the same method that Alfred Huang calls ‘Eight Coin Magic’ in his Complete I Ching: laying out eight tokens around a ring of trigrams. (The trigram-ring – another ‘Paper Horse’ painting – is provided at the back.) So this deliberately excludes all the subtleties that are created in readings by the interaction of different changing lines, or their absence. Of course I’ll tryusing the book at least once with the casting method suggested – but I’ll be keeping it close to hand for all readings, for the insights it offers into the meanings created by hexagram and trigram relationships. I think that’s the particular gift of this book: tapping into the full, multidimensional ‘you are here’ capacity of these structural relationships and making them eloquent – something that belongs in a reading, not just in an interesting reference chart somewhere. I’ve only used the book for a couple of readings so far, but its words are already turning out to have that ‘jumping off the page and talking to you’ quality about them."

307,"In my first publication, I Ching Primer ( in Mexican Spanglish slang, Ching is an obscene word)  I introduced my new Flux Tome Perspective and the Oracle Blank to allow all Yi Oracles to be written and analyzed on a pre-printed form. Rather than having different graphic lines for the Oracle line values of six, seven, eight, and nine, assigned to static or moving, Yang line or Yin line; my novel idea was to interpret Yang and Yin as Figure and Ground of Gestalt.Thus all Oracles take form in a standard Matrix of six broken lines like Hexagram Two Homeland. What makes the difference between the hexagram Two form or matrix and the Oracle Blank to record any and all I Ching Oracles is what is  marked in the space between the two broken lines at each level. A line value of 6 which is a moving Yin line is marked with an X showing material being absorbed from the Environment to fill in this open Yin space and change it into a Yang line.A line value of 7 which is a static Yang line is marked by filling in this space to make a single solid  or Yang line.A line value of 8 is an Open Yin space that is left blank to form a static Yin Line.A line value of 9  is marked with a  line filling the gap between the two pieces of the form matrix and with a circle indicating this Yang line is moving, expressing and exhausting itself, diffusing out into the Environment which will change this line eventually into an Open Yin space.This use of six broken lines as Matrix for the graphic representation of any and all I Ching Oracles results in an alternative view of Hex 2 Homeland:Thus all Oracles take form in a standard Matrix of six broken lines like Hexagram Two Homeland. This Matrix of the Great Mother Planet Earth with the six broken lines represents the six categories of elevation in Planet Earth Topography from Sea Level to  High Mountains Top.  The first level  and the first line is the Sea Level and the entirety of the World’s Oceans with their primal source of life and oxygen and abundance of sea food.Level Two is the elevation of rivers, streams, and ground water. Level Three is that of the rains that fall and the runoff from fields and villages into the streams and rivers. This completes the Lower Trigram of  the Water Cycle.The upper trigram is the three elevations of the Land. Fourth level is the valley floors where crops are easily grown in flat fields with good drainage.The fifth level is that of the world of human habitation and development, the general topography and geography of the various nations and their land mass. The top or six level is the high mountains that represent the sacred heights and panoramic scenery of  those special mountain ranges that create the character and exalted beauty of our environment.In my description of this active graphic marking of the line values in this column or channel between the ends of the set of six broken lines (Hex Two) I referred to this as the Birth Canal of the I Ching Oracle.Women friends of mine who had given birth objected saying that nothing happens in the birth canal, all development takes place in the uterus. I was aware that birth complications and problems like Kaiser Wilhelm II terrible forceps delivery tragedy generally occur in this passage through the birth canal from the uterus to independent air breathing as a living baby with its own breath or soul and thus horoscope.So I am now using the technical terms currently in medical use:From http://www.epigee.org/pregnancy/afterbirth.htmlClick to expand...While your baby travels through the birth canal, his body begins to produce two hormones: adrenaline and noradrenalin. Your baby will never again produce such high amounts of these two chemicals. Both chemicals help to make your baby's trip a successful one. The adrenaline aids your baby in adjusting to the air environment he will soon encounter. This chemical opens up his lungs and dries out his bronchi, preparing him to breathe. The noradrenalin works to slow your baby's heartbeat. This helps him to go without oxygen for a prolonged period as he works his way out of the birth canal.In general, your baby shouldn't have too much trouble making his way into the world. His body should pass easily through the birth canal. His head, however, may be a different story. This is actually the most troublesome part of your baby to make its way out of the birth canal. Luckily, the skull isn't completely hardened at birth, allowing your baby's head to be gently altered in order to help it pass through.During birth, the vagina is often referred to as the birth canal. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VaginaClick to expand...Now I am in the process of expanding my original remarks, published in 64 numbered pages and VI pages of introduction in my I Ching Primer into a complete Flux Tome Perspective I Ching explanation of each of the 64 hexagrams and their 6 component lines.The link to these new web pages on my website is:http://www.stars-n-dice.com/vaginaliching.htmlDr. Frank R.

313,"I’ve been taking a good, long look at the Way of Harmony I Ching software. It’s designed to encourage that kind of steady, take-your-time approach: it offers you gentle colours, the option of soft background music or sounds, and a simple, uncluttered interface. Some real thought has gone into creating a piece of software that allows for a spacious experience of divination: there are relaxation instructions and audio guides available to use before consulting; there is information on Taoism; divination is introduced as an intuitive, meditative process. It may be a computer program, but it doesn’t reduce divination to a ‘press button, get answer’ process. (Hooray.) Also, it doesn’t dogmatically impose this approach; if you want to open the program and cast a hexagram quickly, you can. (Hooray, again.) It’s true that this software has been around for a while, and the interface has an old-fashioned feel to it. But it also feels friendly, and there is plenty of good stuff hidden behind its simple initial menu. Under ‘Additional features’ > ‘Insight screen’ there’s consistently lucid, thoughtful advice on approaching and using the oracle (though you’ll want to take the ‘history’ section with a pinch of salt), as well as an introdction to Daoist texts and practice. There’s good information on trigrams with additional hexagram commentary based on their qualities under ‘Additional features’ > ‘Trigram chart’. It’s not always obvious where everything is (for instance, there’s commentary on the significance of each line position under the heading ‘Trigram chart’), but you can explore without getting lost; it’s always easy to get back to the main screen. Another good thing: there are many helpful suggestions for further reading, including a generous review of the San Shan Yijing software – I think that speaks volumes in itself. The journal function is easy to use, with a list of past entries to review and edit. The journal is also the place to go to find the commentary on any hexagram, just by clicking on it in the list on this screen – so if you want to chronicle past readings here, or just browse the hexagrams, you can. However, there is no journal search, which is likely to get awkward if you store a lot of readings here. Still another good thing: in addition to the straightforward three-coin approach, and the option of entering a reading you’ve cast yourself, there are a couple of imaginative approaches to selecting a hexagram. There’s a ‘mirror reading’, where you’re guided through a landscape and component trigrams are selected according to the paths you choose to explore. And there’s intuitive selection: an animation of the hexagram sequence that stops when you click; you can have it whiz past too fast for your conscious mind to follow, and watch and absorb the change – and click to stop it if and when you feel the right moment to do so. (I found I’d stopped it at hexagram 54, the primary hexagram of my reading for the year.) For the sake of completeness, I should give you the not-so-good things. Firstly, a minor technical glitch in Windows 7: if you use alt+tab to move between open programs, Way of Harmony doesn’t appear on the list. So it’s possible to open the software (which occupies the full screen),* use alt+tab to switch to another program – and then be unable to find your way back. But this isn’t an insurmountable problem: if you reduce any other programs you might need for your consultation to something less than full screen, you can keep Way of Harmony visible and accessible in the background. You may find this doesn’t bother you at all once you get used to it – download a free trial and see. Another disadvantage: this won’t work as a sole resource for your readings, as it doesn’t include a full translation – just commentary on/ paraphrase of the Judgement, and an almost-translation of Image and line texts. The commentary is unique to this software, and it’s good. A couple of examples – just small excerpts from longer commentaries - Hexagram 1:“The Creative…* is thespiritual spark which initiates the creative cycle of nature.The Receptive responds by providing a vessel to shapethe spirit energy’s potential into energetic form.”​ Hexagram 2:“You are invited to welcome the receptive energies that thisHexagram represents and to reflect on how its simple, open,and  devoted responsiveness expresses itself in your life. Thetime  favors relaxed listening, intuitive knowing, and tuningmind and  feeling to the often unconscious rhythms of nature.”​ The author regularly uses ‘you are invited’ as an opening phrase, and characterises each hexagram as a time with its own unique qualities. But that almost-translation, using some but not quite all of the original, inevitably loses some of its specificity and vividness. The horse’s lost yoke-mate in 61.4 becomes ‘you turn away from your companion’. ‘This makes my heart ache’ in 48.3 becomes ‘a sad situation’. The flowing tears of blood in 3.6 become ‘profound wounding’ (though he does then quote the original in the commentary!). And so on. It’s a shame. He’s also made some clear choices to change the translation of the Image: the ‘noble one’ is abolished and replaced with the ‘way of heaven’ or ‘way of development’ or ‘way to connect people to heaven’, and so forth. I can understand a desire to avoid the idea of a ‘superior person’, but I don’t think depersonalising the text actually helps. There are more drastic changes at Hexagram 8, where the image of the king investing in his chosen relationships, building cities to connect with his feudal lords, is swapped for a general ideal of universal human fellowship. He explains what he’s doing, and why, but something is lost. Each hexagram commentary concludes with a poetic reflection on the hexagram, called ‘Beyond the Changes’. Here’s an example from Hexagram 61:Patiently waiting in the depths of an open heartis the doorwayto the wondrous mystery of your ultimate nature. Gently devoted to truthPerfectly surrendered to the wholeness of the Tao… Sincere good fortune.​ There is an unpretentious, simple approach throughout the commentary and the software as a whole; infused by the author’s Daoist view, it seems designed above all to draw you into the experience of divination. That makes it a good option for beginners; true, it would be a vastly better one if only it included a full translation, but it does recommend good books – and not just tucked away in a ‘further reading’ section, but after the commentary for every hexagram. The author’s very clear that his words are meant just as a ’starting point for your journey’. A highlight for me is the substantial essay on ‘Creative Consultation’ you can find via the ‘insights screen’. It doesn’t say anything startlingly novel or scintillatingly brilliant – it just gives wise, down-to-earth, lucid advice on approaching the Oracle. For beginners, it lays good, lasting foundations; for others, it contains good, welcome reminders. I’d recommend you download the free trial if only to read it."

322,"He Tu is the other magic number. To most people, He Tu has been considered as the River Map. This is one of the misunderstanding when translation coming to place. Let 's take a look at the word ""He Tu"". The correct original word of ""He Tu"" is ""Hà Đồ""""Hà"" is the short word for ""Thiên Hà"", which means ""Heaven"" or ""Universe""""Đồ"" is the short word for ""Bản Đồ"" which means ""Map""Putting the 2 words together ""Hà Đồ"", we have the correct meaning ""The Map of the Universe"".

325,"Hi, some of you may know these sites, but I didn't find them in ""search"", so I wanted to share:Together with Bradford and LiSe translations, I use this great resource:http://ichingyafines.googlepages.com/los64hexagramasThis ""compendiu"" is basically a compilation of tranlations and comments on each hexagram. Included authors go from Wilhem to Karcher, Carol Anthony, Blofeld, J.C. Fernandez, LiSe and many more. It's incredibly useful and complete. It includes an analysis of relating hexagrams, trigrams, plus judgment, image and lines. Just to give you an idea, each hexagram is covered in a 100 page pdf, that's still easy to read and browse through.Some sections od some hexagrams might be in English, but it's mostly material in Spanish.If I can't toss my actual coins, the best on-line I-ching I found is this one:http://www.losarcanos.com/iching.phpI like this one because, instead of randomly generating one hexagram, you have toss 6 times to build it, and in that way it emulates reality as best as possible. After you are done, it will display both hexagrams and changing lines. The explanation / interpretation given there is VERY poor, so I just use it to generate the hexagram. And though it is in Spanish, it can be easily used by anyone.Hope you find this helpful!"

336,"Yi Jing iphone app Updated With Two New Translations(Likely release date: July 21, 2009)[July 21-22, 2009 is date of the longest Total Solar Eclipse until June 13, 2132]Southborough, MA - Flat Earth Studio today announces its version 1.3 software update for Yi Jing, also known as I Ching, the Book of Changes, for the iPhone and iPod touch. This update includes “Yi Jing / Book of Changes” by Gregory C. Richter, and “Gia-Fu Taoist I Ching” by Gia-Fu Feng and Frank R. Kegan. “Yi Jing / Book of Changes” is a direct translation from Chinese with pinyin (contemporary standard pronunciation), gloss, and a clear English translation. Gregory C. Richter is a professor at Truman State University in Kirksville, MO, who has taught linguistics, German, Russian, Latin, French, and Chinese. Originally from California, he earned a Ph.D. in Linguistics at the University of California, San Diego in 1983. He has previously translated poetry in Icelandic and French, psychoanalytic works in German, and Buddhist scriptures in Tocharian. His translations from Chinese include a rendering of the Tao Te Ching (The Gate of All Marvelous Things: A Guide to Reading the Tao Te Ching, Red Mansions Publishing, 1998, distributed by China Books, San Francisco).“Gia-Fu Taoist I Ching” is a Taoist translation of the 1716 Yi done at Stillpoint in 1974 by Gua-Fu Feng with Frank R. Kegan. Gia-Fu was a true Chinese and a natural born Taoist who revered the I Ching as a Chinese Classic. He worked on translations of Taoist texts with the Stillpoint community. Frank R. Kegan brought to Stillpoint his experience with the Oracle of the I Ching and his involvement as a professional astrologer in his community back in Chicago. Gia-Fu took refuge in their work on the taoist Translation of the I Ching from the chaos of American culture. By the end of summer 1974, their work on the I Ching was complete and Frank retired from Stillpoint with their unpublished manuscript in its Kinko’s copy shop paper bag until now.Yi Jing v1.0 was chosen as an iTunes App Store Staff Selection in May 2009. The v1.1 update, with Carol K. Anthony’s “A Guide to the I Ching” in both English and German, and the v1.2 update with minor enhancements to the journal, have both received uniformly positive reviews.I Ching (Yi Jing) is the definitive mobile version of I Ching, the Book of Changes, done the way it was meant to be experienced.

So now it is incumbent upon me to make a relevant I Ching News thread about this major eclipse next week. So, here goes...Granted that Wilhelm  notes the context of hex 55 being a Total Solar eclipse in commentary upon some of the  lines (like 2 and 3); however, looking at that hexagram in light of such a context makes all the lines make more sense it would seem that next week could be a great time for an empirical experiment in the results of a Yi Oracle answer of hex 55.The trigrams involved, thunder and lightning represent cause and effect since they always follow one another (cf. hex21) Here Li is under Chen and there is no simple overall image such as an open mouth with a stick in it. So, the cause-and-effect notion is not generalized as justice so much as focused into that precise and well-documented pattern that the Earth will line up exactly between the New Moon conjunction resulting in a visible Total Eclipse of the Sun.So, how do YOU experience a major event like this in YOUR Yi Oracles? Does the context of the massive eclipse (beginning July 21st--like two minutes before midnight 22 July GMT and lasting until a bit after 5 am GMT--here in US Pacific Time Zone it starts at 7:30 pm on the 21st).Overall, I expect it will be a major event in the lives of us each and all with major news impacts as well. So, as a matter of I Ching News--what is the news of how the eclipse affects YOU and your Yi Oracles?FrankLast edited: Jul 17, 2009"

Omens can be received. Heaven hold many secrets. All these can be known by consulting the Zhouyi. Over the years, one has blogged enough to prove beyond any reasonable doubt that it can be and has been done. Pigs and fishes may still remain unconvinced. But revealing omens and/or heaven’s secrets too often, has its drawbacks. Even divinities (Daoist deities and celestial immortals) have their limits, the Yi had once told me. While lucky enough not to be struck by lightning, it can damage one’s health or pockets. The loud encroaching thunders can be rather frightening, especially when it is not raining, while one types out the secrets for blogging.After giving out the omen on the wind borne diseases and the air disasters, the Yi had wanted to tell me something else. Upon consultation, the prognostication given seems to be another omen or heaven secret to complete the four seasons of 2009.This time, instead of revealing the heaven’s secret or omen in the explicit manner like in previous occasions over the past few years, one would present it in the form of a Guan Yin qin (divination slip) adding on an ‘ancient’, to assist clarity. (I have tested it two nights ago, and there was no usual rumbling from Heaven.)It could also provide an opportunity for the esoteric, Yi aficionados and Daoist devotees to ‘crack’ their heads over what is the revelation – the heaven’s secret. Readers can try to decipher the message(s) from heaven and comment, if they so wish. Spring winds borne diseases. False hope and black hands hide heaven.Summer air disasters. No parts or poor maintenance. Autumn rains rockets. Watch the south east region.Winter drum beats in the distance. Pigs cry, fish laughs, and cranes fly home. Ancient (Gu Ren) for the latter two seasons: Guan Lo advises Cao Cao not to move. Allan Lian's blog of the 17th  clarifies   a warning on July 12,2009:Moving heaven and earth The ancients say that sincerity is part of human nature. And that sincerity is the way of heaven. According to the Doctrine of the Mean (Zhong Yong), there are different levels of sincerity and the most complete of it allows the Yi diviner to divine like a spirit (shen). The Judgment in Hexagram 61 Zhong Fu / Inner Truth says:Inner Truth. Pigs and fishes. Good fortune. It furthers one to cross the great water. Perseverance furthers. Commentary:Pigs and fishes are the least intelligent of all animals and therefore the most difficult to influence. The force of inner truth must grow great indeed before its influence can extend to such creatures. In dealing with people as intractable and difficult to influence as a pig or a fish, the whole secret of success depends on finding the right way of approach. One must first rid oneself of all prejudice and, so to speak, let the psyche of the other person act on one without restraint. Then one will establish contact with him, understand and gain power over him. When a door has thus opened, the force of one’s personality will influence him. If in this way one finds no obstacles insurmountable, one can undertake even the most dangerous things, such as crossing the great water, and succeed. [Wilhelm / Baynes] If you have ever visited pig or fish farms, you may find that pigs and fishes are happiest when it comes to feeding time. Just like humans, creatures need to eat, to fill their empty stomachs. To the pigs and fishes, their owners by feeding and taking good care of them are sincere. This can also apply to reliable teachers and students. Nine in the second place means:A crane calling in the shade. Its young answers it. I have a good goblet. I will share it with you. Confucius says about this line:The superior man abides in his room. If his words are well spoken, he meets with assent at a distance of more than a thousand miles. How much more then from nearby! If the superior man abides in his room and his words are not well spoken, he meets with contradiction at a distance of more than a thousand miles. How much more then from nearby!Words go forth from one’s own person and exert their influence on men. Deeds are born close at hand and become visible far away.Words and deeds are the hinge and bow spring of the superior man. As hinge and bow spring move, they bring honor or disgrace.Through words and deeds the superior man moves heaven and earth. Must one not, then, be cautious? The great sage advised that in our dealings with people and/or nations by way of speech, writing and/or action, the Junzi have to be sincere, reliable, and cautious. Since their words and actions can move (gan dong) heaven and earth. If their sincere words and deeds can begin to move heaven and earth, do they not have the same effect with pigs and fishes?Just like the current handling of the two ‘nuclear’ nations by world leaders and the UN Security Council, if they do not put in more sincerity that can even influence pigs and fishes, they may realize too late what they should have done to avoid an omen or heaven’s secret given by the Yi.""Last edited: Jul 19, 2009"

344,"Very recently, there was a series of conversations in the Midaughter's mailing list about the concept of Yin-Yang and how it applied to the Yijing; a sort of chicken-and-egg discussion, and unfinished, IMO. I contributed an excerpt from Lars Berglund's PhD dissertation, ""The Secret of Luo Shu,"" that I typed and made available in Google Docs. Here is the link:The Ancient YinYang-ConceptA few surprising posts in there. My thoughts are that the Yin-Yang/Wuxing concept--something not compiled, but existing, until Zou Yan put his elaborated ideas down in paper (now lost, for the most part)--, is much more ancient than the Zhouyi proper. Perhaps the genesis of the Zhouyi might be unrelated to the correlative thinking underlying the Yin-Yang/Wuxing concepts but they did fuse together under the canonized Yijing and the exegesis that followed."

The main text is a new interpretation of each hexagram and line in the I Ching. One of the main unique factors in this interpretation is the all references to the superior man and his superior virtue and ethics have been removed. There is no male or female in the hexagrams. One does this or one does that. It is written to the individual in everyone who will run into freedom and responsibility and in the process with the help of this new version, might be able to stay out of trouble and free of blame.The main text also presents the hexagrams in association to the corresponding degrees of the zodiac.

Labouring since 1992 at creating an Etymological Companion to the study of the Yi Jing, a common denominator issued from 84 world versions, I see more than ever that the toughest is always the last 100 yards. The 1353 pages included between its covers will require many months of exclusive dedication before I hand it down to Shambhala Books, time borrowed from my ''regular'' work (Anthropologist).   I therefore need a small helpful contribution from you to see it through and offer something unique in return.   The Yi Jing Study Companion's cover artwork will depict the 64 hexagrams as were found at Ma Wang Dui in Zhuanshu characters( the world's oldest Yi Jing). I have made these out of Chinese Ink on Rice Paper and wish to offer Clarity exclusive samples to help finance my dedication. These will never be seen anywhere else but on Clarity and only for one month ( since the editing is progressing daily).   These samples are full size 8 X 11 inches on Rice Paper and I offer them for $20 U.S including delivery anywhere in the World.   You should know also that it is my intension to secure some of the money generated by the book and the print and invest it in Clarity ( where we meet and share the wonderful world of the Yi Jing)...Thank you Hilary !

368,"Lao Tzu some theories in honor of his birthday, September 26th​    Lao Tze was said to have been born to a woman of the Fu* who wasespecially beautiful and intelligent. Lao-tze is also known as LaoErh and Lao-tzu. After eating a special fruit the girl becamepregnant. An oracle said that a great spiritual adept was to be bornin the region. My theory is that it may that his mother was a descendant the clan of hereditary court diviners that were Royal Family Diviners in the Shang Dynasty.The Many were the 9th and last province bought into the Shang Dynasty, according to Joseph Needham..  Thereafter, the successor dynasties tried and also have nine provinces.  (Perhaps the magic square comes from this custom) .  Thereafter a  9 tings , bronze ceremonial vessels, were buried with the king but also one ting was buried with the head of each province.  A ting was found buried in Tomb 5 of the Fu Tzu of King Wu Ting's era (the king's tomb had been looted)    These royal women were called the Fu and were descended from these wise women of the villages. It was said that they knew the secrets of divination and had magical powers and wild animals obeyed them. Their fiefdom was known as Tzu. The Royal Family Diviner's title was Fu Hao or Fu Tzu. The first Shang king, Shang Ti attempted to outlaw divination at first by this clan of women but later saw the wisdom in making the head of the clan his Chief Consort and her clan a royal hereditary shih or a high ranking clan of the court.  Technically the Fu Tzu's exact job description was to determine the appropriate sacrifices to made to each ancestor befor the king made a divination using prepared carapaces or undershells of fresh water turtles.     After the fall of the Shang Dynasty Tzu became an honorific used by  the Western Zhou: According to Chang Cheng Lang, the noted 20th century scholar, 'Tzu' was a honorific, a title indicating  a mature and honorable man, who had descended from the Shang .  Of course, Lao Tzu was an archivist for the Western Zhou dynasty. Interestingly, Confucius, also of Shang ancestory on his father's side, was known as Kong Fu Tzu.According to the Sima Quan, the Han historian ""Lao-tzu was a native ofCh'u, of the county of Fu, the village of Li."" the province of Ch'uwould be southwest and not where the many fu were said to have lived.   This idea comes from a claim of the Ch'u province where shamanism had shifted from the northern steppes to this area in the southwest, well inside China and ardently participating in the deification of Lao Tzu into a state religion and promoting Lao Tzu's supposed connection to these forms of shamanism. Of course, its hard to prove of dissprove any of this or my theory as we have so little information in writing and by studying the pictures of Lao Tzu, I propose my own idea:A good pic of Lao Tzu sitting under the peach tree and the fruit ofimmortality (yes, the erh or plum was changed to either a peach or anapricot)with the entrance to Shang-gri-la in the Kunlun shan takenfrom a 14th Century Buddhist writing ( the theory of the Many Fu is also takenfrom Eva Wong's book, 'Taoism') and is found here: htttp://members.fortunecity.com/maryhalpin/id18.htmThe crane in this picture is likely a representation of immortality and/or a symbol for Guan Yin and/or the Many Fu.The second picture of Lao Tzu probably represents the achievement of immortality.  There is an old Taoist prayer which to paraphrase, says:  ""Now take the pen and write your name across the Milky Way, you are immortal!Happy Birthday, Venerable One! *The ""Old Baby,"" had many  names:Lao-tze, Lao Erh, Lao-tzu, Lao-tan to name a few"

370,"I received this by email and I share it.Dear Qi-friends,Greetings to you from the heavily snowing Northwest Pacific! It is unusual to have several days of continual snow in this area, and this is the first time I've seen it since I came here 2001. In Chinese, we have a saying: ""Great snow is an omen for a prosperous year."" Therefore, the beautiful snow here indicates that we'll have a better year.  I'll be happy with 2009 because my new book, Seeking the Spirit of The Book of Change: 8 Days to Mastering a Shamanic Yijing (I Ching) Prediction System,will be published soon by Singing Dragon in London, UK. I hope you'll have a flourishing 2009.Actually, this winter season started on November 7 according to Chinese cosmology. I have been busy teaching workshops and haven't had time to sit down to write this letter. Many friends have asked me if I am still writing my seasonal greeting email because they don't want to miss it. After I finished my last 2008 workshop on December 12, I gave myself a long vacation because winter is the season for relaxing and restoring your life energy. In Chinese inner cultivation traditions, it is time to focus on ""action-less"" and pay attention to your inner space. So, I am sitting next to the fireplace, drinking a cup of tea, and writing this letter before I start my personal cultivation vacation.  The winter solstice day is this Sunday, December 21. It is one of the best times of the year to do your inner cultivation because the universal Yin energy will reach the peak level and the Yang energy will be re-born. So, we should practice Qigong and other inner cultivation to support the return of our inner Yang energy. I invite you to join my inner meditation winter solstice ceremony: At 11:00 p.m. on December 21, light a candle in front of you and do this meditation. First, open your eyes and gaze intensely at the candle light. Then close your eyes and imagine the light in your Dantian (lower belly). Adjust your breathing to be slow and even. Feel each breath making the light brighter and brighter in your Dantian. Meditate as long as you can. Before ending, please say a little prayer: ""May the Spiritual Light shine within my heart and body! May the Spiritual Light shine within my family and friends! May the Spiritual Light shine within all beings! May the Spiritual Light always shine with peace and harmony for the World!""  The really cold winter will start on winter solstice. In Chinese tradition, we enter ShuJiu (which means count nine) on that day, and the first three nine-day (3x9=27 days) periods after the winter solstice will be the coldest weather of the year. Meditating and breathing into your Dantian will ignite your inner fire and maintain your inner peace. And after you work through the difficulty condition, then you'll reach DaHan (Great Cold, one of the 24 energetic segments in the Chinese Yin-Yang Calendar) on January 20, 2009, the day for the great  transition. This will be the day that the old energy will end and the new energetic circle will begin, although the Chinese New Year will be January 26, 2009. On January 20, 2009, the Wood-Wind energy will be in the dominating position in nature.  Transition is never easy for us, and it will be especially difficult for those who have problems with digestion, immune system, joints, or tendons. Cultivate your Earth Qi to strengthen your digestion, and let your anger or inner windstorm out and transform it into a harmonious wind. This will help you deal with the strong Wood-Wind energy. Overall, continuing your daily practice will help you ""surf the wind"" freely during the coming Wind season.Love Qi,Master WuP.S.

374,"I just received this book and it is a nice surprise. It is a little book but it packs an interesting punch and some information that isn't available everywhere. For example, it shares a way of divination that is physical in the sense that involves visualization:""Through the complex use of trigrams and hexagrams, the I Ching becomes, in point of fact, an encoded document that must be approached with a sacrifice of human energy, as that is the only means of decoding it. Taoists call this sacrifice Heng and it is central to cultivating a life informed by the Book of Changes.Let me be clear; this is a direct ""hands-on"" approach and not a theoretical one. The Cultivator deliberately chooses a Hexagram that represents a singular moment in spacetime, determines the critical point of the changing energies present at that moment, determines precisely how the situation is evolving, and sets about mystically exploring the moment. During this process, the Cultivator begins to viscerally experience the holographic interconnectedness of Creation.""​It is written mostly from a Daoist perspective and it has claims of ""oral traditions"" put on paper for the first time, etc. But interesting, nevertheless.

376,"I bought myself a book called The Complete I Ching by Alfred Huang in which he describes a method he has of reading multiple moving lines since often they can be confusing or contradictory.  It is:""1. If there are two moving lines-one yin and the other yang-consult only the yin moving line.2. If the two moving lines are both yin or both yang, consult the lower one.3. If there are three moving lines, consult only the middle one.4. If there are four moving lines, consult only the upper of the two nonmoving lines.5. If there are five moving lines, consult only the other, nonmoving line,6. If six lines are all moving, consult the Decision of the new gua, the approached gua.&. Since there is a seventh invisible line in the first and second gua, Qian and Kun, for these gua consult the seventh Yao Text, called All Nines or All Sixes.""I found this to be a very interesting and concise method but I am confused about one thing: each of these options say to only consult one moving line even if there are several, so do I disregard the other moving lines entirely, because this would change the approaching hexagram. Or do I only consult the one moving line but allow the other moving lines to determine the approaching gua as well? I hope that wasn't too confusing.Thoughts. . .?"

380,"the I Ching community we have a long discussion of who the Eastern Neighbor whose ox sacrifice is criticized by the WB version of Hexagram 63:5. Hexagram 63,  Moving line 5​  a)""The neighbor in the east [the Zhou? my notes only] ​ who slaughters an ox ​ Does not attain as much happiness​ As the neighbor in the west​ With his small offering.​ b) The eastern neighbor, who slaughters an ox, ​ Is not as much in harmony with the time ​ as the western neighbor.​ The latter attains true happiness:  Good​ fortune comes in great measure.""​  I call it the 'simple sacrifice' which WB notes  that since the sacrifice came sincerely from the heart even though the sacrifice was a mere pig was received with greater effect in heaven.  Even the writers of the WB (there is a technical argument that Wilhelm put this in later) disagreed and there is an analysis found in WB 63:5 in the old Commentary.*  The Zhouyi ignores all of this event of the simple sacrifice. The problem has been that the Zhou were thought to be located in the West, not the east. Some ideas have been forth:*Only the Zhou had the Ox Sacrifice for which they were well known*There was an Ox Bow lake the physically placed the Zhou at the time of the sacrifice to the east of the Shang.  There is some good authority for this. *The sacrifices were made while the armies of both the Shang and Zhou were in the field and temporarily the Zhou were in the east. Here is a brief analysis of sacrifices in general but it illustrates how closely the pastoral Zhou were connected to the Ox sacrifice and that the Han commentary of line 63:5 should be suspect.[FONT=Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif]Sacrifices:  Shang to Chou Dynasties[/FONT] . General [FONT=Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif]The King of Heaven, the Nobility, and the Common People were the three subdivisions of the people.

Besides what may be called private sacrifices, the Emperor sacrificed also to the four quarters, and to the mountains and rivers of the empire. [/FONT] [FONT=Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif] At the beginning of his reign and yearly thereafter, or when the center of his kingdom was moved to a new capital, or in times of greatest need,  the king made a pilgrimage to the shrine on the mountain of each of the four cardinal directions that enclosed his kingdom seeking the beneficent influences of heaven by making sacrifices to the deities of each cardinal direction.[/FONT]Zhou Practices [FONT=Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif]When sacrificing to the spirits of the land and of grain, the Son of Heaven used a bull, a ram, and a boar.  The victim, offered by the Emperor in a public display of blazing wood was a young  ox of one color only.  A feudal noble would use any fatted ox; and a petty official, a sheep or a pig. Problems with Han Interpretation of 63:5Li:  Ox or Magic Tortoise? An account of this sacrifice given for a victory over the Huns by the Zhou King is the ""eastern neighbor,""  spoken of in Hexagram 63:5.  The sacrifice in the Hexagram is in the trigram of Li and thereafter the the ox was the animal associated with Li. [/FONT][FONT=Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif]The Han commentator placed Li with the ox due to Li being found in the trigram and so forth but not convincing to me.   [/FONT][FONT=Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif]  When looking at Book III, the Commentaries, Hexagram 49, line 5, one will find the ancient definition of Li as ""the magic tortoise.""  The commentary and discussion of this problem is found in WB 63:5 in the old commentary in the back.   Of course, Li could have been both but the magic tortoise is the animal that holds up the universe and creates this plane of existence by turning the south, the direction of Li.  Li is an elemental hexagram, fundamental to diviners and a source of good energy.  An ox?? An ox is for the pastoral not the elemental.  There is more directional argument of the sacrificed pig being Kan  (North)and thus Li is located to the opposite it   but as one part the hexagram says, 'this is exhausting'.________________[/FONT][FONT=Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif]  *It is clear from a reading of Wilhelm/Baynes, Hexagram 63, Book III: The Commentaries, that the commentators (there are at least two) are deciphering oracle bones or bamboo slips from an earlier time.  All of the line statements are given an alternate interpretations by one or more commentators, one of which is named as Cheng Tzu, (I wish Bradford could find the name of the other one) indicating there was uncertainty as to the meaning of the text.[/FONT]  [FONT=Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif]     .  We can roughly date the interpretation of this Hexagram to the arrival of Buddhism, c. 100 BC based on the line statement of line 2 b) (given as an alternate interpretation, with the reference to ""following the Middle Way,"" a Buddhist concept that arrived around this time.

One of the major discoveries ofYinxu is the inscribed animal bones and tortoise shells, which areknown as the oracle bones.his is the first time that semi-subterranean residences half builtinto the ground have ever been found at Yinxu or among ruins from theXia (2100 BC-1600 BC), Shang (1600 BC-1100 BC) and Zhou (1100 BC-771BC) Dynasties. Although the unearthed rooms are small compared withthe foundations of palaces and temples unearthed at Yinxu, theyreflect the vivid and colorful lives of ancient common people wholived in areas adjacent to the city.The bones and shells that were used for divination by Shang kingscarry the earliest known examples of Chinese characters. The discoveryof the ancient village enriched the study of Yinxu culture, accordingto Wang. The newly excavated houses were concentrated and laid out onnorth-south lines. The houses were properly spaced for ventilation andall the rooms were connected by ""halls"" and ""living rooms"", similar tomodern buildings. Experts believe that earthen platforms found in somerooms were used as ""beds"".

It runs under Windows, from W95 to Vista, and may interest to some of the members of this group.Some relevant features:The Oracle can be consulted either with the coins or the yarrow-stalk method, using an animated interface.Oracle answers can be stored in a database. Afterwards they can be searched and analyzed with different tools.Guidance for interpreting the Oracle answers is provided, so users can know how which are the key points in the situation. (I adhere to Steve Marshall adaptation from Zhu Xi for mutating line selection).Hexagrams include both the Wilhem-Baynes translation plus an interpretation targeted to diary life.The program is easy to understand, allowing easy navigation between linked hexagrams and the English and Chinese text.A Chinese text pane, with a literal word by word translation of the Book of Changes, can be opened, side to side to the Wilhelm translation. This feature is very handy or the serious I Ching aficionado, since only in that way one can apprehend the whole range of meanings or the Oracle answers (the Chinese text is taken from the Zhouyi Zhezhong. I tried to follow Wilhelm in its amendments to the text) . Users can add their own words and insights to the text, creating in that way their own version of the I Ching.It is not free, but the text can be read freely in the evaluation version, and the oracle can be consulted 30 times. The program is only 2 MB size, can be uninstalled easily, and the installer doesn't mess with the System, since all files are installed in the program folder.

400,"Greetings All,    I finally got a web page up of my X-Ray Eye horoscope and astrological Yi Oracle. The basic technique groups the 12 signs of the Zodiac into 6 areas to make a linear horoscope chart. Those areas with planets in them are Yang lines in the X-Ray Eye Oracle. Those without any planets are open Yin spaces. Moving lines are also possible.The result is an Yi Oracle based upon a date turned into a six-place hexagram matrix without the need generally for an exact time or location which is generally required for an accurate astrological horoscope.The page also uses Yi or at least hexagram line place imagery to explain the 12 signs of the Zodiac. So, the web page works as an introduction to Zodiac astrology for those familiar only with the I Ching.The link is http://www.stars-n-dice.com/x-rayeye.html Dr. Frank R. Kegan Psy.

He has a new page, now, on creating a 'spread' of hexagrams for your birthday:http://www.jamesclairlewis.com/pages/iching/birthday.htmlYou'll need to start at his hexagram index first, both for hexagrams arranged as binary numbers, and for an explanation of 'key hexagrams'."
406,"The complete Flux Tome explanation of the I Ching (Flux Tome) is now newly rewritten and online. For those unfamiliar with I Ching Oracle studies independent of the received Chinese texts or traditional commentaries this novel approach breaks with academic tradition, starting by explaining the meaning of a hexagram from just the Yang line places in the 6-stage hexagram matrix. Yin is just part of the background.Since 'Once Is Not Enough'... The meaning of the hexagrams is also explained by their position in the King Wen Sequence in terms of sets of 10 hexagrams with each set overall described in the hexagram whose sequence number ends in 1 (1,11,21,31,41,51, and 61) with the meanings of all the other hexagrams being that first monad of the decad viewed in terms of a standard set of perspectives: The Dyad (hexagrams ending in 2 and 3), Triad (hexagrams ending in 4,5,6), and double dichotomy Tetrad (hexagrams ending in 7,8,9,0)... which can also be associated with the Chinese T'ai Chi (yang/yin symbol).This explanation of the KW Sequence breaks with the superficial  detail that the King Wen Sequence is  structured in terms of 32 pairs, each even numbered pattern being the opposite of its preceding odd numbered hexagram. Like a sonnet rhyme scheme, these pairs are just part of the elegance of the final product not at all anything to do with the meaning of the hexagrams or the explanation of the KW sequence. Whatever deep patterning can be found through advanced computer analysis is more a reflection of current fascination with binary switches ganged together to make a framework for programming techniques than anything relevant to the Sequence or hexagram meaning. The Yi hexagram matrix is more like the symbolical version of our brain synapse patterns which store meaning without the intermediary of language--human or computer program code. But that is another issue.Although Ezra Pound did a lousy job translating the Book of Odes from his impression of the ideogram drawings, that isn't the end of associating English language terms to classical Taoist concepts. The fundamental gestalt perspective of the Yi as graphic symbolism is universal rather than contained in ancient Chinese tomb artifacts resting in peace with their occupants.Oracle Interpretation is an act of divination which is an occult art like astrology and the fundamentals of all divination share a range of basics. This opens up a number of connections between Yi oracles and such things as the Sabian Symbols for the degrees of the Zodiac, the patterns on the Pythagorean dice cube, and the structural analysis of Yi oracles as descriptions of relevant process from the unique center of each persons personal perception.http://www.stars-n-dice.com/fluxtome.html now includes:These six independent insights packed into the unique Flux Tome (I Ching) perspective:1. Hexagram meaning from the set of Yang lines only.2. Conceptual ideograms in simple American terms as a dialect of ancient Chinese.3.

409,"As I devoutly hope you know (as I've really messed up on the publicity if you don't), I'm running an I Ching class starting on April 2nd - and with the 'early bird' deadline for reduced price tickets on next Wednesday, March 19th.  If you're interested, there are lots of details here. If you're not, there are plenty of interesting threads in the other forums  Questions people have emailed me so far: Can I attend from the USA?Click to expand... Yes. Or from anywhere at all with a phone line. Won't there be international call charges?Click to expand... Not if you're in the USA, no. I'll be using a US-based conference service.   Actually, you needn't pay international call charges from anywhere. When I use this same service for a weekly call, I dial in with Skypeout. Very cheap, and quality just as good as a phone. I have some years' experience with the Yi. Will this be too basic for me?Click to expand... Hmm... possibly... in the sense that we are starting with the interpretive fundamentals of finding a question, connecting the two hexagrams, dealing with multiple moving lines, and so on. If you already have a working relationship with Yi that you're perfectly happy with, and no great desire to add to it in any way, then this is not the place for you. On the other hand, the people who've signed up so far are all quite knowledgeable.   And speaking for myself, I've found that there's always a great deal to be learned from revisiting the fundamentals - I'm certainly learning a lot even as I write the handouts and reference material for each call. I expect to learn a whole lot more from the discussion, from the group's shared readings, and from the group 'thought experiments' and individual assignments.Also, though we start with basic building blocks, we'll be building up to some more unusual interpretive tools and ideas that could well be new to you. Will this be too advanced for me?Click to expand... Not unless you don't know what a hexagram is. And even if you're unclear on the basic mechanics of the thing, you can still right-click here and download the beginners' course to get up to speed before we start. Drop me a note if you have questions (of course). I can't make it to all the calls. Will there be a recording, and should I still sign up?Click to expand... Yes, there will be recordings of each call - mp3 files you can download and listen to where and when is convenient for you. There's also a pdf handout for each call, and forum discussions where you can communicate with the group. So you won't miss any information if you miss a call, and you won't be 'left out' either. But since the calls are a place to ask questions, participate, explore ideas and get your share of the group's attention for your reading... they are valuable, and you wouldn't get the full value just by listening to the recording. So if you're likely to miss a lot of them, the I Ching course, which works with individual tuition by email and isn't time-sensitive, is probably a better option.  Are there still places available on Wednesday/ Sunday?Click to expand... Yes to both, at the time of writing.More questions? Please ask away."

This includes a sample oracle interpretation from just the two hexagram numbers, the names and line pairs.Stars And Dice was a book I published in 1984 upon my initial insight that the signs (and everything else) in astrology could be explained by the dot-patterns on the Dice Cube.Then I noticed that the line places of the I Ching hexagrams were also in the same patterns of the dice cube--environment line pair (1 & 6), Will line pair (2 & 5) and heart line pair (3 & 4) each pair adding to 7  like dice numbers. I have written  on this site of the connection between the King Wen Sequence and the sets of 10 hexagrams and the Pythagorean sets of the tetraktys. Other details include the explanation of astrology (and I Ching [Flux Tome]) from the timing analogs connected to the Big Bang of current astronomy through the cycles and tides of angular momentum in our Solar System--and not Newtonian gravity or Relitivity rubber sheet space-time based on doubletalk about a 19th century geometry that has never been proven consistent.Check it out, I look forward to any comments or reactions from the Yi Community.

426,"If I come for a personal reading face-to-face, rather than by email, what happens?We sit on cushions on the floor drinking jasmine tea and discuss what you want to ask the oracle. This is the best way to consult the I Ching, as a certain 'something' is transmitted by personal contact. I don't do many in-person readings in a year and from time to time I withdraw from giving them. This kind of reading to me is what the I Ching is all about. The very act of coming to the oracle in this way can be a powerful experience. When you have your question, the I Ching is consulted. We discuss what it says and I give you my interpretation if it is unclear to you. People often understand it straight away, because it accords with their own intuition about the situation, confirms it. A consultation can last an hour or two. I don't impose an arbitrary time limit on it, but it wouldn't take more than two hours, usually less. Each consultation has its natural close.

435,"Confucianism even in its primordial form had possessed the all-adoptive and creative spirit, and Confucianism at its very beginning had established inseparable relations with the Yi ! The relationship between Confucius and Yi Zhuan  (the Commentaries on the Yi ) has always been a focus argued by the experts at the Yi  and Confucian scholars. Lacking of convincing materials in the past, the relationship between Confucius and Yi Zhuan  had been veiled. Yet, the Yi Zhuan on silk excavated in Mawangdui and published in 1990s recorded the discussions on the Yi  between Confucius and his disciples. These manuscripts could prove the facts that Confucius had studied the Yi , acted by principles implicated in the Yi , and could verify Sima Qian and Ban Gu's assertion that Confucius “was interested in the Yi  in his later years” and studied the Yi in such an earnest way that “the thong threading through the bamboo slips broke three times”. These evidences directly refute the suspects in the history. The Yi Zhuan  on silk opened a new academic vision for us to make clear how the Zhouyi was adopted into Confucian system and turned out to be a treasure communicating the heaven and human.http://zhouyi.sdu.edu.cn/english/newsxitong/selectedPapers/2007127105458.aspSome newly translated materials plus recent archaeological discoveries indicate that Confucius, after leaving the Zhou court where he was a minor official in animal husbandry (but also seemed to be involved with the important rites associated with the regulation of the health of the animals throughout the kingdom  traveled and taught among the Shang, now called the Sung or Song (pronoun..'soong'). Confucius was still relatively young at this time. Confucius' father had been a Shang military officer but had died young.  His mother took him back to her own state of Lu where he was raised.  It was said that Confucius never knew where his father's grave was located.  Perhaps much of the good works down by Confucius at the city-state of Sung were a tribute to this father he never knew.  Prevailing wisdom has it that Confucius in his later years only lamented that he wished he had more time to study the Yi. Recent evidence points to Confucius' dedication to Yi studies from his beginnings as a teacher (his middle years until his death... the Yi Zhuan on silk excavated in Mawangdui and published in 1990s recorded the discussions on the Yi  between Confucius and his disciples. These manuscripts could prove the facts that Confucius had studied the Yi , acted by principles implicated in the Yi , and could verify Sima Qian and Ban Gu's assertion that Confucius “was interested in the Yi  in his later years” and studied the Yi in such an earnest way that “the thong threading through the bamboo slips broke three times.”http://tinyurl.com/3catnp . When Confucius went to live among the Sung (now a city-state) the Yi had nearly died out among them.  It appears that one reason for Confucius' visit to Lao Tzu ( 'I have met him ande he is a dragon!') was actually for the purpose of bringing the Yi back to the Sung where he established a school for study of the Yi that included the copying of the Zhouyi on bamboo slips kindly allowed to the  Sung by the Zhou.  It appears that the Guicang, originally said to be written during the Xia and  Shang Dynasties was also restored to them:.The Book of Rituals) , there is along paragraph describing Confucius ""wishing to study the politicalideology of the Shang ( �� ) (Yin, �� ) dynasty. After proving thatthe Song did not have enough documents, tai bu (Confucius) came to research Kunqian ( �� , the ancient name for what is currently referred to as Guicang ).""  See Midaughter's List Message 8345  I wonder why the wording of the Zhouyi and the Yi Jing of the Sung is strikingly different in places and why the Sung version,especially Book III, The Commentaries and the Great Treatise have really taken their place among world literature while the Zhouyi seems to be of lesser stature. Whatever the reason, Confucius restored the study of the Book of Changes from the Xia, Shang, and Zhou to the Song where a school for the study of these ancient works was established.Most people do not realize that Lao Nauxian was himself of the Sung Dynasty and that Nauxian-Wilhelm-Baynes is a Sung Dynasty work; it is not the Zhouyi (The Changes of Zhou).  Of course, this work was not available to the West until NWB was published first in Germany (1924?) and then English in 1950.  Do we have Kong Fu Tzu to thank for this?  It looks like it.

There is a love that moves the stars, but we dont always experience it down here.A new image of the Self/I Ching is emerging, that has both a light and dark side.

Have you suffered  at the hands of the churlish ruler in the 2nd place in the 55th hex. how about the powerful inferior who is hindering your deliverence in the 6th line of the 40th hex.

446,"Roll up, roll up, get your tickets here! (Or whatever. ) Just a couple of weeks to go before Margaret Pearson's return visit. This one will be a bit more tightly focussed than the last, concentrating specifically on a few hexagrams with references to marriage and wives - 54 and 37, for two. Margaret will give us some historical/cultural background to the hexagrams, covering the different kinds of marriage at the time the book was written. I'll fill in some modern divinatory applications/implications of all this. (I'm gathering together a few examples of marriage imagery in non-relationship readings.) Lively discussion will no doubt ensue. The basic idea is that the clearer and more specific we can get about the nuances of cultural meaning at the time, the clearer and more specific we can get in readings now. It's a matter of getting a good, solid foundation to build on, instead of a sort of gloopy mush of 'well, it's some kind of union...' Last time around, Margaret surprised me with her willingness to help interpret someone's reading then and there, and it turned out that her approach and mine dovetailed nicely. So we'll do the same again this time, for a couple of attendees. Just 20 seats in the room this time - 16 left as I post this. Tickets on sale here!"

461,"I have added three new papers to my web site, http://www.yijing.co.uk. All of these are available through the PAPERS section of the site.  The first paper is in the Algebraic subsection, and the second and third are in the General subsection. ""Flowers and Steps in the Boolean Lattice of Hexagrams"" provides a detailed analysis of Karcher's Steps of Change, Secter's Transition Hexagrams and Change Hexagrams, and Hacker's Hexagram Flowers. It shows how all of these techniques can be understood as special cases of the Boolean lattice structure of hexagrams. This, in turn, is taken to provide further evidence of the utility of an algebraic approach to the structure of the symbols of the Yi Jing.  This paper is currently under submission to ""The Journal of Chinese Philosophy"". ""The Nature of Divination"" - this short paper, submitted to the journal ""Counselling in Scotland"", looks at the process of divination and develops a simple theory based on the cosmology of the Yi Jing itself.  This theory of process links together the circumstances generating the question, the person asking the question and the Book of Change and suggests that these three entities stand in the same relationship as the domains of Earth, Man and Heaven. ""Great Polar Fist and the Book of Change"" - this paper, which originally appeared in print in Tai Chi Chuan & Internal Arts, the journal of the Tai Chi Union for Great Britain, looks at the connections between the martial art Taijiquan, which is based on the use of yin and yang in the domain of physical movement and self-defence, and the Yi Jing, which explores yin and yang in terms of cosmology and situational analysis.  The basic conclusion is that there are connections, but these connections exist at the deep levels of the two practices, rather than at their superficial levels. Thanks for your interest Andreas"

463,"I would like to recommend a book that I just received and that recently came out (Nov/2003). It is called:  The Essentials of the Yi Jing by Chung Wu, Ph.D. ISBN 1-55778-827-8 Here is something from the back cover: The Yi Jing (I Ching or book of Changes) is a classic in Chinese literature that provides a philosophy and also a practical way to anticipate the future by means of divination. Most students of the Yi Jing have focused on one aspect and ignored the other. Historically, advances in classical Chinese culture were made by academics, not by diviners. Modern Chinese scholars study this classic for the wealth of its philosophical thought and literary style in the same manner they study other Confucian classics. In the West, since its introduction in the eighteen century, however, it has aroused more interest as an aid for divination, like Tarot, than as a work of scholarship or philosophy. This book integrates these long separated strands. Working with the original text and with the historical treatments of the Yi Jing in both Chinese and Western culture, Dr. Wu has translated and annotated this ancient classic for students and serious readers. He corrects past misinterpretations, omissions, and foreign ideas that were introduced to the original text. He provides the reader useful charts and commentaries, making this the most unified, comprehensive, and detailed explanation of the Yi Jing. Chung Wu was born in China and was privately tutored in the classics of Chinese literature and practiced calligraphy as a young student. Throughout his life he has continued studying Chinese literature. He earned a B.S. in Chemistry at Fukien Christian University in 1941 and a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 1952. Dr. Wu has published articles on China including in Collier's Encyclopedia. Mr. Wu was born in 1919. Luis"

We have scheduled the next International I Ching Meetup Day for Saturday, June 14th at 3 pm (and the 2nd Saturday of every month after  that). See the details here: http://iching.meetup.com"" True, when I looked there was just one person signed up, but it's a nice idea. Anyone interested can register at the url above."
473,"I think this one is new - it's new to me, at all events. http://www.iching.fr.st/ has French and English versions of a book that synthesises the insights of many translations and commentaries. There's some worthwhile information here, though it's easier to get at if you can read French."
474,"Visit this one now! Original articles by the author of the (totally fascinating) Mandate of Heaven, including an ultra-sensible one about what to avoid. Book reviews, with lots of information in their own right, reprinted from the lovely old Yi journal, Oracle. (Don't miss the first article here, it's a classic.) A Big5 Zhouyi, complete. And a links page which I think includes some Yi websites I didn't know about - which I didn't think was possible. It's also the only links page that ever made me laugh out loud. Added to which, the site looks gorgeous. I'll be adding this to my links page at the earliest opportunity, but it most surely counts as I Ching News in the meantime."
475,You are welcome to flash I Ching... http://www.sark7.republika.pl/htm/ie.htm Greetings Krzysztof
476,"Joseph Yu, co-author of the 'Complete Idiot's Guide to the I Ching', is taking bookings for his correspondence course in wen wang gua (interpreting the Yi through a highly complex, technical method without reference to its words). This will set you back $400. Here's the link to the course contents list, registration form, and a fragment of a sample lesson."
477,"An upgrade for the software has been posted onto the san shan website, for both the unlimited evaluation and the fully registered edition. Details of the upgrade and the download files themselves are available from www.sundialler.com/yi_jing"
478,"I am also happy to announce the release of the new Four Pillars & Feng Shui 4.1 software. This software now contains a full fledged I Ching program with many new possibilities like ""Visual I Ching"", and a new date/time method. You can find all information about this new version here: http://www.fourpillars.net/fpfs.html Download for a free 30 day trial here: http://www.fourpillars.net/download.html Enjoy. danny"
479,"In case you have missed LiSe's post over at the Divination Discussion section... ...she's found what looks very much like the source of the hexagrams themselves. A brand new theory of why hexagrams look as they do, and what they originally represented. Hm, I'd call that I Ching news... If you go straight to her site, you'll find a link directly to 'From Gui to Gua'."
480,"Thanks to Mick, I actually do have an I Ching news snippet to start this topic off. He's given me a new reading of his for my pet project,  I Ching Resources. This latest addition is under Hexagram 36. (OK, so it started off the page on Hexagram 36.) Of course, any other contributions would be very gratefully received... "
